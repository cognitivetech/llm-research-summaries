## Introduction
**Historical Large Language Models (HLLMs)**

**Background:**
- Traditional behavioral science focuses on present day studies
- Limitations: no access to historical data
- Criticism for being too parochial, call for expansion beyond WEIRD societies
- Need to incorporate diverse historical data for generalizable theories

**Introducing HLLMs:**
- Generative models trained on historical corpora
- Simulate responses of populations no longer living
- Offer opportunities to gather historical psychological data

**Advantages of HLLMs:**
- Create new opportunities in behavioral science research
- Expand understanding of human nature beyond present day societies
- Provide insights into various historical attitudes and behaviors

**Examples:**
1. Comparing cooperative tendencies: Vikings vs Ancient Romans vs Early Modern Japanese
2. Exploring gender roles: Ancient Persians vs Medieval Europeans
3. Addressing hard-to-answer questions

**Benefits:**
- Escape from temporal trap in behavioral science research
- Diversify data beyond present day participants
- Enhance understanding of historical societies and their psychological aspects.

## Timely Tool

**Large Language Models (LLMs)**
* Massive neural networks trained on natural language data
* Understand and generate natural language output
* Predict probable words based on sequence of prior words
* Fine-tuned through supervised learning for specific tasks
* Transforming psychology and adjacent fields
	+ Simulate human responses across domains
	+ Replicate patterns in moral judgment, economic game behavior, cognitive biases, obedience experiments
	+ Used as substitutes for human subjects with caution
* Limitations:
	+ Reflect the cultures on which they are trained
	+ Limited cross-cultural generalizability due to WEIRD sampling bias
	+ LLMs reflect the psychology of different cultural groups through training on different corpora.
* Previous techniques for inferring psychological tendencies from text data:
	+ Google Ngrams, newspapers, movie dialogue, etc.
	+ Limited to indirect proxies for psychological traits and tendencies
* Proposed use of HLLMs (High-level Language Models) to venture beyond existing techniques.

## Careful Training

**Historical Language Models (HLLMs)**
* Simulate responses of diverse past societies using modern psychological instruments and behavioral measures
* Enable measurement of historical populations' responses without direct access to living individuals
* Based on large corpora of historical text, including fiction, diaries, letters, scholarly texts
* Reproduce psychological responses of historical populations (13)
* Insight into thinking of populations no longer living
* Study trends in psychological tendencies over longer time spans
* Test historical generalizability of contemporary psychological phenomena
* Complement qualitative approaches used by historians
* Encouraging first steps for simulating historical samples for research (MonadGPT, XunziALLM)
* Unclear how accurately these models reflect the true underlying mindset of past populations.

**Building a Historical Language Model:**
1. Acquire sizable amount of historical text from a specific time period
2. Convert text to machine-readable format
3. Encode vectors and feed them to neural network architecture
4. Generate probability distributions for words
5. Create an LLM
6. Use chat interface to simulate participants and run psychological experiments.

## Challenges and Caveats

**Challenges and Caveats for Historical Language Models (HLLMs)**

**Acquiring Sufficient Training Data:**
- Smaller training corpora compared to current LLMs
- Historical texts may not be representative of the population as a whole
- Elites are overrepresented in historical text, potentially skewing results
- Validation through other archival sources and traditional approaches needed

**Benchmarking:**
- Limited availability of benchmarks for HLLMs due to lack of contemporary human data
- Use of historical psychology, ethnographic data, and archaeological data to assess accuracy
- Experts can fine-tune models based on socioeconomic status effects in modern populations

**Generalizing from Historical Text:**
- Substantial challenges in creating representative samples of past populations
- Importance of validating results through multiple sources and approaches

**Potential Solutions and Future Directions:**
- Combining HLLMs with other research methods and approaches
- Continued development of computational tools for working with historical data
- Increased availability of larger, more diverse historical text databases.
