## 1 Introduction

**Constructivism in Language Models**

**Learners' Knowledge Acquisition**:
- Learners construct new understandings and knowledge through experience and social discourse

**Large Language Models (LLMs)**:
- LLMs, e.g., GPT-4 OpenAI and LLaMA, have shown strong emergent abilities and convincing performance in NLP tasks
- However, they suffer from the **hallucination problem**, **outdated parametric memories**, and **unreliable outputs**

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Models**:
- RAG models retrieve knowledge from external corpus and build a brute-force RAG architecture by directly feeding passages to LLMs
- However, the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented models is highly influenced by the noise from retrieved knowledge

**ActiveRAG**:
- ActiveRAG focuses on mitigating the effect of noise from retrieved passages by self-reflection and self-refining
- It filters out irrelevant passages or conducts summarized noting to extract key point knowledge, which is effective in assisting LLMs to generate more accurate answers

**Limitations of Passive Knowledge Acquisition**:
- Vanilla RAG and Chain-of-Note models yield inaccurate answers, highlighting the limitations of passive knowledge acquisition
- Vanilla RAG is misled by certain ambiguous entities; Chain-of-Note employs shallow relevance modeling

**ActiveRAG**:
- ActiveRAG leverages active learning to augment knowledge comprehension by bridging the gap between prior knowledge and retrieved information
- It enhances the active learning capability of LLMs without requiring further fine-tuning
- ActiveRAG uses a three-step pipeline: Retrieval, Knowledge Construction, and Cognition Nexus stages

**Experiments and Results**:
- Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of ActiveRAG across various question answering datasets, yielding over 5% improvement compared to baseline models
- ActiveRAG exhibits robustness and maintains stable performance across different datasets and varying numbers of retrieved passages
- Knowledge construction outcomes can be generalized to different LLM architectures, aiding them in leveraging external knowledge and achieving improvements exceeding 20%

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Models**

**Background:**
- RAG models aim to retrieve external knowledge and enhance language models
- Strong effectiveness in various NLP tasks: question answering, dialog understanding, code generation, etc.
- Utilize dense retrievers as knowledge-seeking modules, prompting language models to generate results based on retrieved knowledge

**Earlier RAG Models:**
- Optimize models to leverage external knowledge and serve knowledge-intensive tasks
- Develop architecture of generator to fully use external knowledge
- Train more accurate retriever using feedback from generation models
- Jointly train retriever and generator

**RAG in Large Language Models (LLMs):**
- Leverage external knowledge to reduce perplexity in general NLP tasks
- Alleviate hallucination problem by updating outdated or long-tail knowledge

**Challenges:**
- Noise from retrieved contexts challenges effectiveness of RAG models

**Approaches to Mitigate Noise:**
- Eliminate irrelevant contexts: use natural language inference, summarization models, conditional cross-mutual information
- Self-RAG: LLMs filter out irrelevant passages via self-reflection
- Adaptively retrieve passages or build noting mechanism to summarize key point knowledge from retrieved passages

**Constructivism Theory:**
- Associates external knowledge with prior knowledge
- RAG models continue to passively acquire additional knowledge, often overlooking the importance of this connection.

## 3 Methodology

Introduction to ActiveRAG method:
- This section presents our ActiveRAG method (Sec. [3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.13547v1#S3.SS2 "3.2 ActiveRAG"))
- Guides LLMs to actively learn knowledge from retrieved passages (Sec. [3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.13547v1#S3.SS2 "3.2 ActiveRAG"))
- Based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models (Sec. [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.13547v1#S3.SS1 "3.1 Preliminary of RAG Models"))

(Note: ActiveRAG stands for Revealing the Treasures of Knowledge via Active Learning)

### 3.1 Preliminary of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Models

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

**Existing RAG Models**:
- Utilize retrieval models to search passages `D={d1,â€¦,dn}`
- Enhance the generation ability of language models by grounding these retrieved passages

**Vanilla RAG**:
- Employs the **retrieval-generation architecture**
- Directly feeds the retrieved passages `D` to language models to generate answers for query `q`
- Retrieved passages contain noise, and this **brute-force approach** tends to constrain the benefits of RAG modeling

**RAG with Self-Refining**:
- Avoids the effect of the noise from retrieved passages
- Employs the **retrieval-refining-generation architecture** to empower the capability of RAG using LLMs

**Self-RAG and Chain-of-Note**:
- **Self-RAG**: Summarizes knowledge from retrieved passages, focusing on finetuning LLMs to adaptively retrieve and control information flows
- **Chain-of-Note**: Designs instructions to self-refine the retrieved passages and forms query-focused summarization, applicable to black-box LLMs like GPT-3.5
- Neglect the nature of active learning, where the learner actively constructs their understanding and knowledge by integrating new information with prior knowledge

### 3.2 ActiveRAG: RAG with Active Knowledge Learning

**ActiveRAG Architecture for Active Learning**

**Background:**
- Inspired by constructivist learning theory: Steffe & Gale (1995)
- LLMs actively acquire knowledge through ActiveRAG pipeline

**Components:**
1. Retrieval
2. Knowledge Construction
3. Cognitive Nexus

**Knowledge Construction:**
- Four agents for knowledge acquisition: anchoring, logical reasoning, cognition, association
- Human learning behavior mimicking
- Detailed descriptions in Sec. 3.3

**Cognitive Nexus:**
- Facilitates fusion of constructed knowledge understanding with intrinsic cognitive processes of LLMs
- Employed to assist LLMs in utilizing external knowledge for augmentation
- Fusion occurs during the generation of a chain-of-thought
- Encourages reflection and rectification of potential factual errors
- Differs from RAG models: emphasis on incorporating knowledge construction into cognitive reasoning.

### 3.3 Knowledge Construction from Different Learning Views

**Constructivism Learning Theory**
- **Active process**: learning involves construction of internal mental representations
- **Structural knowledge** and experiential backgrounds encompassed
- **Four agents to acquire knowledge:** Semantic Association, Epistemic Anchoring, Logical Reasoning, Cognitive Alignment

**Semantic Association (Associate)**

- Consolidation of foundational and advanced pieces of knowledge
- Expands cognitive boundaries for a comprehensive understanding

**Epistemic Anchoring (Anchoring)**
- Represents previously unknown knowledge
- Establishes foundational understanding
- Incorporates new concepts relevant to the question

**Logical Reasoning (Logician)**
- Draws logical conclusions from structured information
- Refines problem-solving capabilities
- Constructivism learning theory: not merely about absorbing information but active construction of knowledge through reasoning

**Cognitive Alignment (Cognition)**
- Deals with knowledge that contradicts pre-existing understanding
- Prevents factual errors and mitigates hallucination of Language Models (LLMs)

**Data Statistics**
- Each dataset consists of 500 questions randomly sampled from the raw dataset
