| Objective     | Build general linguistic knowledge                    | Specialise model for specific tasks          |
| Process       | Data collection, training on large dataset            | Modify last layers for new task, train on new dataset |
| Model Modification| Entire model trained                                | Last layers adapted for new task             |
| Computational Cost | High (large dataset, complex model)           | Lower (smaller dataset, fine-tuning layers) |
| Training Duration | Weeks to months                                     | Days to weeks                             |
| Purpose       | General language understanding                      | Task-specific performance improvement         |

### 7.1 Steps Involved in Evaluating and Validating Fine-Tuned Models 
- **Set Up Evaluation Metrics**: Choose appropriate evaluation metrics, such as cross-entropy, to measure the difference between predicted and actual distributions of data. (Section 7.2)
  *Cross-entropy is a key metric for evaluating LLMs during training or fine-tuning.*
  *It serves as a loss function, guiding the model to produce high-quality predictions by minimizing discrepancies between predicted and actual data.*
- **Interpret Training Loss Curve**: Monitor and analyze the training loss curve to ensure the model is learning effectively and avoid patterns of underfitting or overfitting. (Section 7.3)
  *An ideal training loss curve shows a rapid decrease in loss during initial stages, followed by a gradual decline and eventual plateau.*
- **Run Validation Loops**: After each training epoch, evaluate the model on the validation set to compute relevant performance metrics and track the modelâ€™s generalization ability. (Section 7.4)
- **Monitor and Interpret Results**: Consistently observe the relationship between training and validation metrics to ensure stable and effective model performance. (Section 7.5)
- **Hyperparameter Tuning and Adjustments**: Adjust key hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs to optimize model performance and prevent overfitting.

### 7.2 Setting Up Evaluation Metrics
- **Cross-entropy**: Measures the difference between two probability distributions (Section 7.2.1)
  *It is crucial for training and fine-tuning LLMs as a loss function.*
- **Advanced LLM Evaluation Metrics**: In addition to cross-entropy, there are advanced metrics like perplexity, factuality, LLM uncertainty, prompt perplexity, context relevance, completeness, chunk attribution and utilization, data error potential, and safety metrics. (Section 7.2.2)

### 7.3 Understanding the Training Loss Curve
- **Interpreting Loss Curves**: Look for ideal patterns like rapid decrease in loss during initial stages, gradual decline, and eventual plateau. Identify underfitting (high loss value), overfitting (decreasing training loss with increasing validation loss), and fluctuations.
  *An effective fine-tuning process is illustrated by the curve's effectiveness in reducing loss and improving model performance.*
- **Avoiding Overfitting**: Use regularization, early stopping, dropout, cross-validation, batch normalisation, larger datasets/batch sizes, learning rate scheduling, and gradient clipping. (Section 7.3.2)
- **Managing Noisy Gradients**: Use learning rate scheduling and gradient clipping strategies to mitigate the impact of noisy gradients during training.

### 7.4 Running Validation Loops
- **Split Data**: Divide dataset into training and validation sets. (Section 7.4)

- **Record Results**: Log validation metrics for each epoch. (Section 7.4)
- **Early Stopping**: Optionally stop training if validation loss does not improve for a predefined number of epochs.

### 7.5 Monitoring and Interpreting Results
- **Analyze trends in validation metrics over epochs**:
  - **Consistent Improvement**: Indicates good model generalization with improved training and plateaued validation metrics.
