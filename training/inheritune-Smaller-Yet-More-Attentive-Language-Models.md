## Abstract

**Large Language Models (LLMs)**
- Achieved remarkable performance across natural language processing tasks
- Due to transformer architecture and self-attention mechanism

**Observation**:
- In standard decoder-style LLMs, attention matrices degenerate to single-column for deeper layers
- These **lazy layers** are unable to learn meaningful information and mostly redundant

**Goal**:
- Train smaller models by eliminating this structural inefficiency without compromising performance

**Proposed Solution: Inheritune**
- A simple yet effective training recipe for developing smaller, high-performing language models

**Approach**:
- Smaller models inherit early transformer layers from a larger pre-trained model
- Retrain and progressively expand until they match or exceed the performance of the larger model

**Results**:
- Demonstrated to enable the training of various sizes of **GPT-2 models** on OpenWebText-9B and FineWeb_Edu datasets
- Smaller models trained with Inheritune achieve comparable or even better performance than their larger counterparts
  - 16-layer GPT-2 medium variant achieves comparable performance to the standard 24-layer GPT-2 medium model

## 1 Introduction

**Language Models (LLMs)**
- Large Language Models (LLMs) built using decoder-style transformer blocks: Vaswani et al., [2017](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.08634v2#bib.bib44)
- Designed for depth and size, improving performance with increased model capacity: Kaplan et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.08634v2#bib.bib25); Hoffmann et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.08634v2#bib.bib23)

**Attention Mechanism in LLMs**
- Crucial component for capturing long-range dependencies and contextual relationships within text data
- As models grow deeper, encounter attention degeneration: Noci et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.08634v2#bib.bib32); Dong et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.08634v2#bib.bib13); He et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.08634v2#bib.bib20)
- Not studied in standard LLMs: Section [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.08634v2#S2 "2 Attention Degeneration in Standard Decoder-Style LLMs ‣ Inheritune: Training Smaller Yet More Attentive Language Models")

**Attention Degeneration and Lazy Layers**
- Observed in GPT-2 medium (24 layers) and large (36 layers) models: Radford et al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.08634v2#bib.bib36)
- Characterized by rank-1 attention matrices with single-column structures: Figure 1(a) and (d)
- Termed "lazy layers": Figure 1(c) and (f)

**Inheritune Training Approach**
- Proposed method to develop performant small base language models using weights from larger base LMs
- Initializes smaller model with a few early blocks from the larger pre-trained model
- Continuously grows and trains the smaller model, incrementally adding more blocks until it surpasses the reference model's performance: Figure 2(a) and (b)
- Effectively trains high-performing, smaller models while preserving effective attention patterns: Figure 2(c)

**Key Contributions**
1. Analysis of Attention Degeneration and Lazy Layers in standard LLMs
2. Introduction of Inheritune training approach for smaller yet more attentive language models
3. Validation of Inheritune's effectiveness through comprehensive experiments on various baselines: Tables 1 and 2; Figure 3
4. Improved performance in settings with non-repeated training tokens: Figure 4

## 2 Attention Degeneration in Standard Decoder-Style LLMs

**Preliminaries:**
* A vanilla transformer-model consists of L transformer blocks (layers)
* Model operates on input sequence X∈ℝT×d
	+ T: sequence length, number of tokens
	+ d: embedding dimension or hidden size
* Output of each layer l is denoted as X(l)∈ℝT×d
* Each transformer block consists of self-attention block and position-wise FFN
* Self-attention mechanism enables relevance weighing of tokens in sequence
	+ Queries Q, keys K, values V are linear transformations of input X
	+ Attention matrix A(X) captures pairwise attention scores between tokens
	+ Softmax applied row-wise to compute weighted sum of value vectors
* Previous research shows self-attention networks (SANs) can exhibit rank collapse of attention matrices
	+ Results in loss of expressive power as model attends to all tokens uniformly
	+ This phenomenon affects both SANs and feed-forward networks (FFNs)
* Findings do not directly apply to standard LLMs as they include residual connections, layer norms, and FFNs

**Approximate Rank Computation of Attention Matrices:**
* Analyze structure of attention matrices in standard transformer-based LLMs using GPT-2 models
* Compute approximate rank (k*) of A(X) for all attention heads within each layer
	+ Using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and explained variance method
* Determine minimal number of columns (m*) required to capture 90% of total mass
* Analyze degeneration of attention matrices in deeper layers
	+ Many deeper layers exhibit rank-1 attention matrices, indicating reduced performance and less effective token mixing.

**Lazy Layers:**
* Some deeper layers may have completely degenerate attention matrices across all attention heads
* Lazy layers hold less transferable knowledge compared to early counterparts
* Initializing new models with lazy layers extracted from pre-trained models performs similarly to random initialization.

### 2.1 Attention Pattern Visualization

**Visualization of Attention Patterns in Language Models**
- **Vanilla 24-layer GPT-2 model trained from scratch**: Shows a progression in attention patterns as the model deepens
  - Early layers (L4, L7) exhibit structured patterns with local and global attention
  - Deeper layers (L20, L22) display more uniform patterns, indicating loss of focus and lazy layers
- **16-layer model trained using proposed method**: Demonstrates more focused and effective attention patterns even in later layers (L11, L15)

**Inheritune: Training Smaller Yet More Attentive Language Models**
- Algorithm 1: Inheritune training recipe for small language models
  1. **Reference model**: `ℳref` with `k` layers, datasets `𝒟train` and `𝒟val`, steps `𝖳`
  2. Initialize target model `ℳtgt` with first `n=k/2` layers from `ℳref`
  3. Train `ℳtgt` on `𝒟train` for `𝖳` steps
  4. While `ℳtgt` performance < `ℳref` performance on `𝒟val`:
     - Grow `ℳtgt` by inheriting additional layers
     - Train `ℳtgt` for `𝖳` steps
  5. Return optimized model `ℳtgt`
- This method addresses attention degeneration and makes models more attentive, potentially leading to more efficient models in a compact size.

## 3 Inheritune: Our Proposed Training Recipe

**Method Overview:**
* Goal: Develop smaller base language models (LMs) with equivalent or better validation loss compared to larger models
* Principles: Zero-shot initialization and progressive growth
* Three main steps: Inherit, Train, Grow

**Setup:**
* Split dataset into training set 𝒟train and validation subset 𝒟val
* Pre-trained reference model ℳref with k layers (deep LLMs)
* Initialize smaller model ℳtgt with first n=k/2 layers of ℳref
* Train ℳtgt on 𝒟train for T steps, evaluate on 𝒟val
* If needed, increase size and repeat steps 1-2

**Method Description:**
* Inherit: Initialize smaller model with first half of larger model's layers
* Train: Train smaller model for a specified number of steps on training set
* Grow: Increase size and repeat training process until desired performance is achieved.

   - Hybrid stacking (large pre-trained reference model for initialization)
   - Half width (initializing the baseline GPT-2 large variant across the width dimension and preserving the entire depth)
3. **Baselines trained with Knowledge Distillation**:
   - Logit-based knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015)
   - DistillBERT-style approach (Sanh et al., 2019)

### 4.1 Results and Discussions

**Study Findings on Models Trained with Inheritune**

**Key Results**:
- Smaller models derived using Inheritune achieve comparable or lower validation losses than their full-sized counterparts when trained for the same number of steps.
- GPT-2 variants trained with Inheritune outperform their same-sized counterparts trained from scratch, both when trained for the same number of steps and when trained for double the steps (200K).
- Models trained with Inheritune consistently outperform various baselines, including stacking, hybrid stacking, and vanilla or DistillBERT-style knowledge distillation.

**Table 1**:
- GPT-2 xlarge, GPT-2 large, and GPT-2 medium variants trained with Inheritune achieve comparable or lower validation losses than their full-sized counterparts when trained for the same number of steps (100K).
- GPT-2 models derived using Inheritune match their much larger reference models' downstream performance on two next-word prediction tasks in a zero-shot setting.

**Convergence Perspective**:
- Some prior works have made connections between over-parameterization and faster convergence.
- Small LMs derived with Inheritune still converge as fast as their large-size reference models, despite being smaller compared to them.

**Supplementary Figure 5**:
- Shows that small LMs derived with Inheritune converge as fast as their large-size reference models.

**Table 2**:
- Compares GPT-2 xlarge, GPT-2 large, and GPT-2 medium variants trained with Inheritune against same-sized variants trained with stacking, hybrid, and half-width initialization baselines.
- Half-width baseline performs poorly, revealing the limitations of naive width reduction.
- Stacking and hybrid stacking demonstrate reasonable performance but still fall short compared to 𝖨𝗇𝗁𝖾𝗋𝗂𝗍𝗎𝗇𝖾.

**Figure 3**:
- A 16-Layer GPT-2 medium variant derived using Inheritune converges faster and generalizes better than a same-sized model trained with Logit-based distillation baselines (vanilla KD and DistillBERT-style KD).

### 4.2 Ablations

**Experiments on Sub-Module Initializations within a Transformer Block**

**Key Findings**:
- **𝖨𝗇𝗁𝖾𝗋𝗂𝗍𝗎𝗇𝖾 initialization and attention + MLP initialization** result in similar performance improvements.
- **Layernorm initialization** shows minimal impact.

**Ablations**:
- Comparison of validation loss for a 16-layer GPT-2 medium variant with different sets of sub-modules initialized using weights from a 24-layer GPT-2 medium reference model.
- All models trained on OpenWebText-9B dataset.

**Sub-Module Initializations**:
- **1) Attention (key, query, value, and projection, as well as layernorm2 weights)** and mlp weights without the layer norm (attn+mlp w/o layernorm).
- **2) Attention and MLP weights without the layer norm**.
- **3) MLP weights with the layer norm**.

**Initialization Method**:
- **𝖨𝗇𝗁𝖾𝗋𝗂𝗍𝗎𝗇𝖾** performs initialization by inheriting attention and MLP weights with the layer norm (attn+mlp w/ layernorm).

**Results**:
- Table 3 shows validation loss for each of the three initialization methods.
- Detailed validation loss vs training steps plot in supplementary Figure 7.
- Initializing both **attention and MLP weights** provides a clear advantage.
- Initializing either the **attention or mlp weights** results in similar improvements in convergence speed and final validation loss.

## 5 Training without Data Repetition

**Model Performance Comparison:**

**Background:**
- Figure 4 shows that GPT2 models trained using Inheritune without data repetition perform as well as their full-sized counterparts and outperform same-sized models in terms of training loss.

**Investigation:**
- To investigate if the gains are due to overfitting from data repetition, additional training experiments were conducted following standard LLM pre-training practices.
- A high-quality dataset (Fineweb_edu) was used without data repetition for training 32-layer GPT2 large and 24-layer medium reference models, as well as their 16-layer counterparts derived from them using Inheritune recipe and baseline variants.
- All models were trained for 100K steps.

**Findings:**
- Figure 4 indicates that the GPT2 variants trained with Inheritune consistently perform on par with their full-size counterparts and outperform same-sized models in terms of training loss.
- Zero-shot downstream evaluations on ARCE, LAMBADA, SciQ, Hellaswag, PIQA showed that models derived from Inheritune demonstrate superior performance than baseline models trained from scratch (Table 4).
- The average zero-shot downstream performance of the Inheritune-derived models is better than their larger and same-size counterparts.

**Conclusion:**
- The gains observed with Inheritune are not merely a consequence of overfitting due to data repetition.
