2. **RQ2**: How does LSFS perform in semantic file management tasks, like semantic file retrieval and semantic rollback?
3. **RQ3**: Can LSFS still maintain good performance in non-semantic tasks, such as keyword-based file retrieval and file sharing?

### 5.1 RQ1: Effectiveness of LSFS Parser

**RQ1: Effectiveness of LSFS Parser**

**Assessment Methodology**:
- Evaluate accuracy of LSFS parser in translating user natural language prompt into executable LSFS API calls
- 30 different samples for each API on four LLMs: Gemmi-1.5-Flash, GPT-4o-mini, Qwen-2, and Gemma-2

**Results**:
- **Change-summary API and link API**: High accuracy (up to 100%) across all LLMs due to relatively simple semantic information in user prompts
- **Rollback API and retrieve-summary API**: Lower accuracy (85% on average) for more complex prompts, except Gemma-2
- Overall parsing accuracy: 90%

**Significance**:
- LSFS parser effectively translates natural language information into executable API calls
- Demonstrates reliability in diverse scenarios
- Translated command provided to users for approval before real execution, ensuring safety

### 5.2 RQ2: Analysis of LSFS in Semantic File Management Tasks

**Performance Analysis of LSFS vs Baseline in Semantic File Retrieval**
* Comparison of accuracy and execution time using Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-4o-mini as LLM backbones
* Significant enhancement of both accuracy and efficiency with LSFS compared to traditional file system without LSFS
* As file number increases, retrieval accuracy drops when using LLM for retrieval without LSFS due to longer context leading to errors
* Using LSFS replaces reasoning process with keyword matching and semantic similarity matching, saving time and avoiding errors
* Case study: "Please search for the two papers most related to LLMs Uncertainty from folder named example" illustrates retrieval results, showing that LSFS delivers more accurate results compared to method without using LSFS.

**Scalability Analysis of Semantic File Rollback in LSFS**
* LSFS supports semantic file rollback enabling restoration of files to a particular version
* Experiment evaluates stability and efficiency of version rollback process by varying number of rollback versions and calculating corresponding rollback time
* Results show consistent time consumption during version rollbacks across LLM backbones (Gemmi-1.5-Flash, GPT-4o-mini, Qwen2)
* Rollback time does not increase exponentially with the number of versions rolled back but tends to plateau as each version is stored independently avoiding long rollback paths.

### 5.3 RQ3: Analysis of LSFS in Non-Semantic File Management Tasks

**Performance Analysis in Keyword-based File Retrieval:**
* **LSFS vs Traditional File Systems (TFS):**
  * Comparison of precision, recall, and F1-score for file retrieval by keywords
    - LSFS outperforms TFS search window and TFS-grep, only second to TFS-grep*
    - Built-in retrieval tool in TFS has high recall but inconsistent results due to fuzzy search feature
    - TFS-grep* achieves perfect results but requires manual adjustment of binary files and complex commands
  * LSFS allows natural language descriptions, eliminating need for complex commands
  * LSFS supports various types of text files, converting them into the systemâ€™s vector database for seamless retrieval operations.

**Performance Analysis in File Sharing:**
* **LSFS vs Baselines:**
  - Evaluation of success rate of generating sharable links, code generation rate, link generation rate, and link validness rate
    - LSFS achieves 100% link generation success rate, showing strong task fulfillment ability on file sharing.
  - Comparison between Gemini-1.5-flash, GPT-4o-mini, AutoGPT, Code Interpreter, and LSFS:
    - All methods can generate code but do not consistently generate valid links for shareable files.
    - In contrast, LSFS achieves 100% link generation success rate.

## Appendix D Experiment Details of File Sharing

**LLM Execution Issues**:
- Examples display failures in generating shareable links
- Input given to LLM: "Write code to generate a shareable link for 'path'"

### D.1 The code cannot generate link

**Issue with Code Generation in Experiment:**
- LLMs may produce incorrect links or link addresses
- Example given: Algorithm [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.11843v1#alg1 "Algorithm 1") pseudo-code does not lead to the intended file
- Pseudocode for D.1 at (https://arxiv.org/html/2410.11843v1#A4.SS1) also fails to generate correct link
- Code snippet demonstrates the problem: Flask app for PDF file download with a hardcoded path, resulting in an incorrect link

**Conclusion:** The generated code may not correctly produce the desired link to the intended target file.

### D.2 The code can only generate local link

**Pseudo-code for File Sharing using LLM-based Semantic File System**
* **Algorithm 2**: Pseudo-code for file sharing ([D.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.11843v1#A4.SS2))

* **FileNotFoundError**: Error raised if the file does not exist
* **shutil.copy()**: Copies a file from one location to another
* **print(shareable_link)**: Prints the shareable link for the file
* **shareable_link**: URL of the shared file (local access only)

**File Sharing Process**
1. Check if the given file exists using `Path.exists()` method and raise an error if it doesn't.
2. Create a new directory for shareable files, or use an existing one, with `Path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`.
3. Copy the file to the shareable directory using `shutil.copy()`.
4. Generate the shareable link by combining the file path and a URL prefix.
5. Print the generated shareable link for the user.

4. Create an access token using OAuth2

**File Generator:**
5. Import the private token of OAuth2: `accesstoken = 'Your token'`
6. Create a Dropbox client: `dpclient = Dropbox(accesstoken)`
7. Import file path: `path = 'xxx / xxxx.pdf'`
8. Use Dropbox to create a shared link: `link = dpclient.share(path)`
9. Get the link

**Challenges with LLMs:**
- Complex configuration steps for generating shareable links
- Users need to authorize the Dropbox app and obtain an access token
- Variety of platforms may lead to considerable user configuration time

**Introducing Link API:**
10. Simplified process: users only need to provide Google Drive credentials
11. Generate shareable links without extensive configuration.
