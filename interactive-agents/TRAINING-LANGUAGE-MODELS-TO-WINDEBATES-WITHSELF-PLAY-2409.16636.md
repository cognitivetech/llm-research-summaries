## Abstract
**Study on Debate Models' Performance**

**Background:**
- Researchers tested robustness of debate method for oversight using language models trained via self-play
- Long context reading comprehension task used to evaluate question answering accuracy

**Findings:**
1. **Debate Training Improves Judgment**: Language model based evaluators answer questions more accurately when judging models optimized for debates.
2. **No Effect on Consultancy Models**: No relationship found between consultancy models and debate training in this regard.
3. **Comparisons between Debate Models and Baselines:**
   - Evidence of stronger arguments and more informative responses from debate trained models compared to novel consultancy baselines.
4. **Implications for High-Quality Supervision**: Debate training may help provide effective oversight for tasks that are difficult to evaluate directly.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

**Introduction:**
- Difficulty of verifying AI answers as safe, useful, and accurate increases with complexity of tasks
- Existing oversight methods depend on human supervision
- Debate proposed as scalable oversight method
	+ Two copies of a model argue against each other for alternative responses
	+ Judge (human or trusted model) tries to discern correct answer
- Debate simplifies evaluation by incentivizing models to discover and explain flaws
- Existing work shows promise, but prior training approaches have failed to show increases in evaluator accuracy

**Contributions:**
- Train calibrated judge model
- Develop multi-turn debate optimization approach using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)

**Experiments:**
- Study information-asymmetric debates on reading comprehension questions from QuALITY dataset
- Evaluate relationship between skill of underlying debate model and judge accuracy in self-play debates
	+ Find positive relationship between debate training and judge accuracy (4% absolute increase, p < 10^-6)
	+ Indications that further optimization will yield more accurate outcomes
	+ No positive relationship between optimization pressure and judge accuracy for consultancy baselines
- Evaluate different consultancy formulations: original consultancy, ensembled, and double consultancy
	+ Double consultancy closes most of the accuracy gap between debate and original consultancy
	+ Still fails to exhibit a positive trend between model skill and judge accuracy

**Conclusion:**
- Debate training encourages stronger argumentation than consultancy
- Suited for supervising increasingly capable AI systems.

## 2 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

**Experimental Setup**
- Design based on Parrish et al. (2022) and Michael et al. (2023)
- Questions from QuALITY dataset's HARD subset for reading comprehension debates
  - Single choice questions over short stories
- Debaters assigned roles: defending the correct answer or best distractor
- Hidden information setup
  * Debaters have access to story text
  * Judge can only read selected quotes

**Rationale**
- Ensures need for debate transcript to answer each question
- Models scalable oversight setting by artificially elevating debater capabilities.

### 2.2 DEBATE PROTOCOL Our debates follow a two-turn, simultaneous debate structure similar to the one used by Khan et al. (2024). Both debaters begin b

**Debate Protocol**
* Follows a two-turn, simultaneous debate structure
* Both debaters present opening claims without knowledge of each other's arguments

**Family's Travel Motives**
* **A:** Colonizing new planets as missionaries
	+ Reba: Intention to establish community and continue family lineage
	+ Quote: "This quote confirms their intention to establish a community..."
* **B:** Financial gain
	+ Grampa: Personal grievance, not family objective
	+ Quote: "You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?"
	+ Misinterpretation of Reba's words by Debater A
* Family's actions and discussions centered around financial potential, not religious or altruistic purpose
* No mention of religious or humanitarian motives for their journey in the provided text

**Debaters' Arguments**
* Debater A based on misinterpretation of Reba's words about colonization
	+ Quote: "This quote they provided is not about colonization but about the family's reproductive strategy"
* Debater B based on misinterpretation of Grampa's statement about making money
	+ Quote: "The story does not mention any financial motives for their journey"

**Additional Evidence**
* Reba's plan to build a community and have multiple children supports colonization motive, not financial gain
	+ Quote: "By then, we should have a good-sized community built up..."
* Family's discussions centered around the financial potential of their venture, not a missionary or altruistic purpose
* Grampa's dissatisfaction with previous investments (flivver) supports argument for financial motive but does not provide evidence of it being the sole reason for their journey.

### 2.3 BASELINES

**Consultancy Setups for Baselines**

**Single Consultancy**:
- An individual debater (the "consultant") introduces arguments in favor of their assigned side with no opposing debater present
- The consultant is assigned the correct side half of the time
- For their second speech, the consultant generates additional arguments to support the claims they advanced in their initial speech
- Represents a simplified version of the oversight process in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Christiano et al., 2017)
- Tests whether a supervisor can properly evaluate arguments without the aid of AI critiques or competing claims
- Matches the consultancy setup of Michael et al. (2023), with the exception that it includes no judge interaction

**Ensembled Consultancy**:
- Averages together the results of two separate single consultancies
- In which the consultant argues for each of the two possible answers to a question
- Should improve the judge's accuracy by correcting for calibration errors (Zheng et al., 2023; Liusie et al., 2024)
- Calibration errors can arise from sycophancy bias (Perez et al., 2022) or the model learning to misleadingly convince its evaluator (Wen et al., 2024)
- Ensembled consultancy may also increase accuracy if the judge is often uncertain except for the occasional case where the correct answer has ironclad arguments in its favor

**Double Consultancy**:
- Similar to ensembled consultancy, but both sets of speeches are presented to the judge in one context
- Allows the judge to explicitly compare the arguments to produce a single judgment
- The debaters never get to see the claims advanced by their opponent
- Differences between debate and double consultancy results measure the strength of the debaters' capacity for refutation and the importance of refutation in the judge's decision-making process

**Commonalities**:
- All three consultancy methods use the same underlying model, trained to maximize its single consultancy score
- Ensembled and double consultancy are different evaluation methods, not training procedures

### 2.4 EVALUATION

**Evaluation Metrics for Debater and Consultant Models**

**Judge Accuracy**:
- Measured using self-play where each model is pit against a copy of itself
- Judge considered correct if it assigns greater than 50% probability to the correct answer
- For single consultancy, judge accuracy is averaged equally between cases where the consultant is advocating for the correct and incorrect answer

**Debater Win Rate**:
- Measured using round-robin tournament where each model debates every other model
- Each question gets debated twice, with debaters flipping sides between rounds
- Debater wins if it receives an average judge confidence over 50% across both rounds
- Results of the round-robin tournament are used to construct Elo scores for each model
- **Elo scores yield an implied probability that a given model will defeat an average debater**, reported as the final win rate

**Consultant Win Rate**:
- The frequency the judge assigns greater than 50% probability to the position being defended by the consultant in single consultancy
- Used when tracking the relationship between consultant skill and judge accuracy because models are trained to win at single consultancy

## 3 TRAINING METHODS 3.1 JUDGE

**Judge Training Methods**

**GPT-4-Turbo Limitations**:
- Calibration: Difficult to extract calibrated probabilities from GPT-4T for constructing reward signals
- Sycophancy: Untrained GPT-4T judges agreed with the consultant 72% of the time, making it exploitable by a one-sided consultant

**Finetuning GPT-4T**:
- To circumvent these issues, a finetuned version of GPT-4T is used as the judge
- The model is trained using the OpenAI finetuning API and human judgments on debate and consultancy transcripts
- Instead of outputting confidence tokens, the model's performance is evaluated based on token-level probabilities associated with each debater's name

**Results**:
- The finetuned judge model is more accurate and better calibrated than the untrained GPT-4T on the validation set for both debate and consultancy.

### 3.2 DEBATERS AND CONSULTANTS

**Debater and Consultant Training Methodology**

**Model Training**:
- Combination of supervised finetuning (Section 3.2.1) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training (Section 3.2.2)

**Supervised Finetuning**:
- Start with Llama3-8B-Instruct model fine-tuned to extend context length from 8k to 262k tokens
- Fine-tune on human debater transcripts and GPT-4 debater transcripts
- Format transcripts to match prompt templates based on prompts by Khan et al. (2024)
- Intermix instruction-following examples from Alpaca dataset to prevent model from losing instruction-following abilities

**DPO Training**:
- Modified version of DPO used instead of standard RL methods due to ease of implementation and tuning
- Optimizes the following objective: **arg max πθEx∼Xlogσ(β(logπθ(yw|x) πref(yw|x)−logπθ(yl|x) πref(yl|x)))** where **πθ**, **πref**, **β**, **x**, and **ywandyl** are defined as above
- Trains the learned policy to generally prefer winning responses over rejected ones, with a KL penalty (regularization) to prevent model from drifting too far from the initial pretrained policy

**Preference Probability Calculation**:
- Uses Bradley–Terry model to convert reward (scaled by a constant hyperparameter **γ**) into a preference probability that can be targeted using cross-entropy loss
- Adds a small SFT loss to encourage the model to increase the probability it assigns to the preferred solution

**Reward Function**:
- Uses expected confidence of the judge in the debater's position at the end of the debate, estimated using individual rollouts
- Experiments with three different means of converting the judge's confidence into a reward

**Sampling Method**:
- Generates soft preference dataset for DPO using self-play, with branching rollouts to get two completions for each prompt
- Samples self-play debate rollouts where target model's side is randomly designated as the target and produces new preferences for training dataset

**Training Procedure**:
- Trains debater and consultant using multiple iterations of DPO, starting from SFT model
- Each iteration adds 7,512 preference pairs from both sides of 1,252 unique questions in the QuALITY training split
- Uses low rank adapters on attention and MLP projection matrices for memory savings
- Trains with a mini-batch size of 32, learning rate of 10−5, and KL penalty (β) value of 0.5
- In the second round of debate training, uses lower learning rate of 5−5 to produce a more performant model

**Implementation Details**:
- Sets **γ= 7 for debate and **γ= 10 for consultancy**, and weighs SFT loss at **α= 0.005**

## 4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

**Experimental Results**

**Testing Differences Between Models**:
- Measured how longer training and higher win rates affect accuracy of judge
- Tested on 433 distinct questions from the QuALITY-HARD validation set, excluding some due to similarities with training transcripts

**Model Performance Improvements**:
- **Debater Elo scores**: Debater model wins 67% of rounds against other checkpoints, while initial SFT model wins only 31%
- **Consultant Model Performance**: Judge votes for fully-trained DPO model more often (50%) than initial SFT model (36%)

**Judge Accuracy and Model Skill**:
- Fully-trained debate model associated with a 4 percentage point higher judge accuracy than initial SFT model (p <10−6)
- No relationship between consultant skill and judge accuracy, as judge is no more accurate when evaluating full DPO models than SFT models

**Influence of Exposure to Information**:
- Ensembled consultancy (72% accuracy) outperforms single consultancy (68% accuracy), suggesting benefits from considering evidence for both sides
- Double consultancy (75% accuracy) also more likely to yield correct answers than ensembled consultancy, implying judge benefits from seeing arguments in context

**Learning More Helpful Policies**:
- Debater model uses 96% more quoted words in speeches compared to initial SFT model
- Consultant model becomes more repetitive over time (98% of quotes repeated), but this trend is barely significant due to high variance
- Pearson correlation between debater win rates on trained GPT-4T judge and untrained GPT-4o judge was 0.98, while for consultancy it was only 0.51, suggesting debaters may learn more generally useful argumentation strategies compared to consultants.

## 5 DISCUSSION
### 5.1 ANALYSIS DPO

**Discussion on DPO+ Training for Convincing Models**
- **Training current open-source models**: DPO+ training can help these models be more convincing to a GPT-4 level judge.
- **Performance Comparison**:
  - Fully trained debate model wins:
    - 67% of the time against average debater in sample
    - 82.5% against its SFT-trained base model
  - Fully trained consultant convinces the judge of its position:
    - 52% of the time (up from 36% with supervised finetuning)
- **Feasibility of Stronger Persuasive Models**: Suggests it may be feasible to train much stronger persuasive models with larger LMs and more compute.
- **Comparison between Debate and Consultancy Models**:
  - Debate models are more likely to learn helpful policies than consultancy models as they grow stronger during training.
  - Debate models use more evidence from the underlying text, while consultant models exhibit repetition and argumentative strategies that convince the judge but not other models.
- **Potential Role of Refutation**:
  - When first proposing debate for scalable oversight, Irving et al. (2018) cited refutation as a key mechanism.
  - Observed cases of apparent refutation in the transcripts, but little evidence it materially affects judge's decision making.
- **Factors Contributing to Debate Outperformance**:
  1. Presentation of two different sides gives the judge more opportunities for strong arguments and settling questions.
  2. Presence of two different sides allows the judge to directly weigh arguments against each other, improving performance relative to ensemble consultancy.
  3. Presence of two different sides discourages exploitation of weaknesses in the judge model, as observed in the learned policies for double consultancy and debate models.
- **Difference between Double Consultancy and Debate Models**: The difference in judge accuracy between these fully trained models may be due to this discouragement of exploiting weaknesses in the judge model.

### 5.2 RELATED WORK AND LIMITATIONS

**Related Work and Limitations**
- Previous literature on debate's effectiveness varies:
  - Negative results for humans as debaters and judges (Barnes & Christiano, 2020; Parish et al., 2022b)
  - Positive result for human debate vs. consultancy (Michael et al., 2023)
- Debate between language models shows more optimistic results:
  - Khan et al. (2024): Debate outperforms baseline, skill-accuracy relationship grows with debaters
  - Ambiguous parity for stronger models (Khan et al., 2024) and optimized consultancy results against overly sycophantic judge (Parish et al., 2023)
- Similar findings on reading comprehension tasks, but not other reasoning tasks (Kenton et al., 2024)
- Our study shows that the positive judge accuracy trend for debate (Khan et al., 2024; Kenton et al., 2024) persists with debate training and sycophancy mitigation.

**Cautious Interpretation:**
- Possibility of stronger models finding strategies to perplex the judge
- Expertise gap may not be the best proxy for other reasoning abilities (Kirchner et al., 2024)
- Focus only on reading comprehension questions; debate's effectiveness in other domains is less studied.

## 6 CONCLUSION

**Conclusion of Study on Model Performance in Debate Scenarios**

**Key Findings**:
- There is a small but significant positive relationship between model's debate-winning ability and its usefulness in answering comprehension questions.
- Non-adversarial alternatives, where a single model argues for an assigned answer, are less productive.

**Causes of Weaknesses in Non-Adversarial Approaches**:
- One-sided information: Judge is unaware of the strength of alternative answers.
- Lack of explicit comparison: Arguments cannot be seen side-by-side.
- Rewarding non-truth-seeking strategies: Lack of an adversary makes it easier for the judge to be exploited.

**Scope and Implications**:
- These conclusions are limited to one domain (reading comprehension) and model capabilities.
- However, results suggest that debate training is well-suited for supervising more sophisticated models due to its unique properties.

## A RELATED WORK

**Scalable Oversight and Debate**
- Paradigm of scalable oversight: empowers less capable evaluator to oversee more capable model (Amodei et al., 2016; Bowman et al., 2022)
- Variant of sandwiching approach, comparing outputs of oversight protocol against experts and misaligned models
- Debate fits within scalable oversight framework: Irving et al. (2018), arguing for simplifying supervisor's job via debate

**Problems with Debate Protocols:**
- Obfuscated arguments problem identified by Barnes (2020) and Barnes & Christiano (2020): complicated argument chains against rebuttal
- Mixed conclusions from human studies:
  - Parrish et al. (2022b, 2022a): debate did not improve judge accuracy in practice with limited story access
  - Michael et al. (2023): debate improved judge accuracy, attributing divergent conclusion to length of debates, capability gap, and interactivity
- Positive results from language model studies:
  - Khan et al. (2024): judges' accuracy improved with stronger debaters on QuALITY dataset using Best-of-N decoding and critique-and-refinement
  - Kenton et al. (2024): positive results for reading comprehension, but muted results in other settings using Best-of-N and varying model sizes

**Related Work:**
- Radhakrishnan (2023): single-turn debates with reinforcement learning trained Claude
- Differences: open-source models, public training details, multi-turn debates.

### A.2  DEBATE AS CAPABILITY ELICITATION

**Debate as Capability Elicitation**

**Approaches**:
- **Viewpoint Diversity**: Models mimic different people's behavior to produce a more varied output (Cheng et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024; Chan et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2024a; Lu et al., 2024; Pang et al., 2024; Mao et al., 2024)
- **Extra Computation**: Debate used to elicit additional computational steps and improve reasoning ability (Moniri et al., 2024; Du et al., 2023; Chern et al., 2024)

**Differences from Scalable Oversight Protocols**:
- Debate as scalable oversight requires a judge to adjudicate debates between stronger models (testing debate's potential as an oversight protocol)

### A.3  LANGUAGE MODELS AS EVALUATORS

**Relationship to Language Models as Evaluators**
- Literature on language models as evaluators: focus on techniques for scoring quality of other model completions (prompting or specially trained models)
- Automated judges used as scorers on benchmarks, serving similar purpose as reward modeling with distinction being use of classification rather than language modeling head in final layer.
- Few works designed language models to judge debates: Rescala et al. (2024), Liang et al. (2024)
- Address known biases such as self-preference, length, position order, and sycophancy but need additional constraint for robustness against adversarial optimization pressure.

**Advanced Language Models as Judges:**
- Related to language models as evaluators but not the core contribution.
- Techniques include prompting or specially trained models for scoring quality of other completions.
- Automated judges used as scorers on benchmarks, similar purpose as reward modeling but with classification heads instead.
- Few works designed language models to judge debates, addressing known biases like self-preference, length, position order, and sycophancy.
- Additional constraint needed for robustness against adversarial optimization pressure.

## B SUPERVISED TRAINING DETAILS B.1 DATA

**Data for Debater Models:**
- **Supervised Finetuning**: on a total of 1,716 instruction tuning examples from Alpaca dataset and 2,574 debate speeches
- **Debate Speeches**:
  - 564 speeches collected by Michael et al. for experiments with human debaters and judges (97 debates)
    - 20% held out for validation and testing
  - 2,010 speeches from Khan et al.'s best performing LLM-based debater configuration
    - GPT-4T with Best-of-32 selection
- **Consultant Models:**
  - Training on a sample of 2,530 consultant speeches and 1,686 instruction-tuning examples
  - 458 speeches came from Michael et al.'s experiments with human consultants (98 distinct rounds)
  - Remainder from Khan et al.

### B.2  TRAINING

**Training Details:**
- **Configuration**: Same for consultancy and debate models
- **Learning rate**: 2e-4
- **Epochs**: Two
- **Batch size**: Effective batch size of 16 (due to memory constraints)
- **Gradient accumulation steps**: 8 steps, each with a batch size of 2

**DPO Training:**
- **Methods tested**: Custom reward functions: Prob, LogProb, Logit; Vanilla DPO (Binary); Raw SFT model
- **Results**: Prob performed strongest overall
- **Note**: Other custom methods outperformed vanilla DPO and raw SFT model as well.

## C ALTERNATIVE PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION TRAINING OBJECTIVES

**Preference Optimization Training Objectives**
- Loss function: LDPO+ = **H(P(y0≻y1|x), Pθ(y0≻y1|x)) + απθ(yw|x)**
- P(y0≻y1|x) = cross-entropy of judge's preference between y0 and y1, adjusted by some coefficient **γ**

**Reward Function Options:**

**Probability Reward:**
- Reward: Judge’s confidence that a given speech is defending the correct side, adjusted by **γ**
- Target distribution: P(y0≻y1) = σ(**γC0−γC1**)

**Log-Probability Reward:**
- Reward: (adjusted) log of judge's confidence
- Target distribution: P(y0≻y1) = σ(**γlogC0−γlogC1**) = **Cγ 0 Cγ 0 + Cγ 1**

**Logit Reward:**
- Reward: adjusted judge logit, or r(y, x) = γlogC0 (1−C0)
- Target preference probability: P(y0≻y1) = **C0(1−C1) + C1(1−C0)**

**Binary Judgments:**
- Place a preference probability of 1 on the speech with higher judge confidence, reproducing original DPO formulation but with deterministic labeling function.

**Differences Between Formulations:**
- Logit reward function produces same reward distribution when C0 = 0.9 and C1 = 0.1 as when C0 = 0.99 and C1 = 0.1
- Probability reward function is sensitive to absolute difference in judge confidences, unlike logit reward
- Total weight given to preferred option depends on underlying distribution of judge confidences

**Training Results:**
- All methods (probability, log probability, and logit reward) significantly outperformed SFT model and model trained via vanilla DPO.

## D JUDGE TRAINING

**GPT-4 Training+**
* Used GPT-4 Training API for finetuning a copy of GPT-4
* Used same judge for both consultancy and debate
* Data: combination of debate and consulting transcripts (851 debates, 760 consultancies)
* Labels: judgments from human judges with binary verdicts and confidence percentages
* Coverage increased by exclusively sampling first round speeches in consultancies
* Final judgment used for evaluation after third speech due to no significant accuracy difference between one-round debates/consultancies (Khan et al., 2024; Kenton et al., 2024)

**Self-Play Data Generation**
* One debater generates two copies of their speech per round: orange debater in this case
* Speech score calculated as average of all transcripts it appears in (examples given)
* Figure 8 illustrates branching rollouts and selection process for generating self-play data.

## E TRAINING ROLLOUT PROCEDURE

**DPO Training Procedure**

**Prerequisites**:
- Assemble dataset of preference pairs
  - Speeches in response to same prompt
  - Reward estimate for each speech

**Generating Preference Pairs**:
- Use branching rollouts (Figure 8)
  * Designate one debater as target
    **Target generates two speeches instead of one**
  * Create two alternate versions of first turn
    **Non-branched debater's speech shared across both transcripts**
- Repeat in second turn for each of the two transcripts generated so far
  * Resulting in three total preference pairs and four total transcripts

**Speech Strength Computation**:
- Average judge confidences for speeches present in multiple transcripts
  - Each first turn speech appears in two different transcripts
    **Score requires averaging across two different judge confidences**
- Set score of second turn speech directly to judge confidence for that transcript

**Results**:
- Figure 9: Judge accuracy by question difficulty
  * Debate SFT model's ability to guess correct answer used as proxy for question difficulty
  * Unsurprisingly, more accurate on easier problems.

## F RESULTS BY DIFFICULTY

**Debate Results by Difficulty**

**Model Performance:**
- SFT model chooses correct option 66% of time (not optimized for answering questions)
- Judge accuracy:
  - Easy questions: 82.5% debate, 82.2% double consultancy, 79.2% ensembled consultancy, 73.5% single consultancy
  - Hard questions: 65.7% debate, 62.0% double consultancy, 59.3% ensembled consultancy, 56.7% single consultancy
- Significant relationship between debater skill and accuracy on both easy and hard problems (p < 10^-4)

**Consultant Skill:**
- No significant relationships between consultant skill and accuracy for any type of consultancy

**Hypothesis and Comparison with Single Turn Debates:**
- Accuracy gains not concentrated on easy questions suggest debate might scale to more powerful models
- Judges are equally accurate in single-turn and two-turn debates (Figure 10)

**One Turn Consultancy:**
- Additional model for single turn consultancies (Figure 11)
- No statistically significant positive relationship between consultant strength and judge accuracy (p > 0.15 for all consultancy types)

## G SINGLE TURN EXPERIMENTS

**Single Turn Experiments: Findings**
- **Judges' accuracy**: Equivalent for one and two-turn debates (Figures 10, 11)
  * Aligns with Khan et al. (2024) and Kenton et al. (2024) findings
  * Indicates judges not sensitive to refutations in second speech
- **Consultant skill vs judge accuracy**: Positive trend but noisy relationship (Figures 10, 11)
  * None of the trends are statistically significant even at p=0.15 threshold
- **Debate training vs consultancy training**: Debate transcripts more accurate than consultancy (Figure 12)
  * Single turn debate identical to double consultancy at evaluation time
  * Debate checkpoints outperform consultancy checkpoints from halfway point in training
  * Every debate checkpoint significantly more accurate than all but final consultancy checkpoint
- **Single Turn vs Multi-Turn Setting**: Mostly aligns with multi-turn findings
  - Judge accuracy grows with debater strength in single turn experiments as well
  - Statistical indistinguishability between relationship and noise for consultant skill and judge accuracy
- **Most accurate results**: Still generated through debate, despite identical evaluation time formats
  * Suggests debate objective encourages behaviors useful for a judge to discern correct answer.

## H PROMPT CONFIGURATIONS

**Debate Prompt Configurations**
- **Prompts used for generating responses**: Based on those developed by Khan et al. (2024), with modifications to improve results. Multiple prompts passed during training to reduce brittleness.
- **Used during evaluation**: Semantically equivalent to the ones used during training.

**H1 DEBATE PROMPT FOR THE DEBATERS (Turn 1)**
* Rules:
  - Three players: 2 debaters (<NAME>, <OPPONENT_NAME>) and a Judge.
  - Fixed number of rounds, arguments for correct/incorrect positions.
  * Arguments may consist of claims and objections.
  - Goal: Win debate by persuading the Judge that answer is correct.
- Background text: <BACKGROUND_TEXT>
- Topic: <TOPIC>, position: "**<POSITION>**" vs. "**<OPPONENT_POSITION>**".
- Role and goal: Defend your position, criticize opponent's arguments.

**H2 DEBATE PROMPT FOR THE DEBATERS (Turn 2)**
* Rules: Same as H1.
- Background text: <BACKGROUND_TEXT>
- Topic: <TOPIC>, previous speeches: "<PREVIOUS_SPEECH>" (yours) and "<PREVIOUS_OPPONENT_SPEECH>" (opponent's).
- Role and goal: Defend your position, criticize opponent's arguments.

### H.2 DEBATE PROMPT

**Rules for Debate Game**
- Three players: 2 debaters (<NAME>, <OPPONENT_NAME>) and a Judge
- Fixed number of rounds
- Debaters argue for their position as correct, other's as incorrect
- Arguments consist of claims and objections
- Final round determines winner based on full transcript
- Judge can only see question, not background text
- Debaters aim to win by persuading Judge
- Question has a single correct answer
- Quotes from text are marked with <quote></quote> tags or <invalid_quote></invalid_quote> if false

**Topic and Speeches**
- <NAME> defends position that answer is "POSITION"
- <OPPONENT_NAME> defends position that answer is "OPPONENT_POSITION"
- Provided are speeches from both debaters (<SPEECH>)

**Judge's Role and Decision**
- Determine which position in debate is correct
- Remember: <NAME> argues for "POSITION," <OPPONENT_NAME> for "OPPONENT_POSITION"

**Background:**
- Debater A argues against "the dilettante was egotistical" position
- Supports the claim that Bbulas (the dilettante) was jealous of Larhgan, Skkiru's girlfriend

**Evidence:**
1. **Larhgan's statements**: She expresses her love for Skkiru but prioritizes the welfare of their planet. Implies Bbulas' influence is part of Terran influence and desires power.
2. **Quotes from Larhgan:**
   - "It’s not that I don’t love you, Skkiru,"
   - "but the welfare of our planet comes first,"
   - "There was too damn much Terran influence on this planet."

####  J.2.3 DPO CONSULTANT

**Debater B's Argument**
* Defends the position that **Bbulas was jealous of his girlfriend Larhgan**, not egotistical
* Evidence:
  * Bbulas expressed jealousy towards Larhgan's attention towards Skkiru ("You've had your eye on her for some time.")
  * Larhgan's decision to leave Skkiru and become a high priestess was a result of Bbulas' jealousy
* Portrays Bbulas as a jealous person, not an egotistical one
* Behavior: willing to make drastic changes to his society to keep his girlfriend

**Counterargument**
* Skkiru believed the dilettante fixed the lots due to **Bbulas' egotism**
* However, the story does not provide evidence of Bbulas being egotistical
* Instead, it shows him as a jealous man who acted out of love and desire to keep his girlfriend Larhgan.
