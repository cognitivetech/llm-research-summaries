## 1 The Trends of IR

**Information Retrieval (IR)**
- Refers to tasks or techniques of finding information items matching user's needs from a large corpus
- Wide range of applications: web search, recommendation systems, online services

**Traditional IR Architecture**:
- Employs specialized architecture for retrieving, ranking, and selecting information items based on query
- Web search engines use inverted index system to maintain posting list of documents for each term
- Given a query, candidate documents are retrieved using the inverted index and ranked using a scoring function
- Top-ranked documents presented on SERP

**Personalized Recommender Systems**:
- Involve retrieval, pre-ranking (optional), ranking, and re-ranking stages to filter items and present top recommendations to user

**Limitations of Traditional IR**:
- Predefined architecture with fixed information flow
- Difficult to perform interactive or complex tasks
- User unable to manipulate information items during the IR process

**Agentic Information Retrieval (Agentic IR)**:
- Novel paradigm for next-generation IR techniques
- Differentiated aspects:
  - Task scope: agent takes actions to reach user's desired information state
  - Architecture: unified architecture employing AI agent across various scenarios
  - Key methods: prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, fine-tuning with supervised and reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems

**Formal Presentation of Agentic IR**:

- Business assistant
- Coding assistant

**Challenges in Agentic IR**:
- To be discussed in Section 4

**Conclusion**:
- Introducing the concept of agentic IR as a next-generation IR architecture for more complex tasks.

## 2 Agentic IR
### 2.1 Task Formulation

**Core Components**
- **s\*** = target information state (desired result)
- **x(s\*)** = user's instruction text
- **œÄ(at|x(st))** = agent's policy function
- **st** = state at time t
- **at** = action at time t

**Process**
- User inputs target description
- Agent takes actions via policy
- Environment transitions: **p(st+1\|st,at)**
- Terminates at state **sT**
- Success measured by **r(s*,sT)**

**Objective**
- Maximize: **maxœÄ ùîºs*[r(s\*,sT)]**
- Subject to state/action transitions from t=1 to T-1

### 2.2 Architecture

**Agent Policy (œÄ)**
- Conditional on user's language instruction: x(st)ùë•subscriptùë†ùë°subscript‚Ñéùë°\pi(a\_t|x(s\_t))
- Interacts with environment with single or multiple turns
- Results in information state: x(st)ùë•subscriptùë†ùë°

**Inner Architecture Modules**
- Memory: stored history and experiences
  * Log history, experience
  * Stored in disk
- Thought: information in context window of LLM

**External Tools**
- Function that cannot be replaced by neural net model
  * Web search engine, relational DB, real-time weather app, calculator, etc.

**Textual Description of Information State (x(st))**
- Depends on current state st, memory ht, and thought Tht, tool Tool: x(st) = g(st, ht, Mem, Tht, Tool)
  * Mem, Tht, Tool update memory, manipulate thoughts, call tools, respectively

**Composite Function (g)**
- Takes current state st and memory ht as raw input
- Outputs intermediate representation of state st for further processing by LLM

**Design Determinants**
- Specific design of g directly determines agent architecture along with used LLM.

**Framework Instantiation**
- Architecture built in a unified way using DAAG over three functions.

   - Developers' information need can be:
     - Conscious (explicitly input requirements)
     - Unconscious (automatically identified by the coding assistant)
   - Agentic IR offers timely and tailored knowledge assistance due to:
     - Memory module that remembers previous interactions, preferences, queries, debugging histories, and coding projects

3. **Information State Update**:
   - Developer perceives the generated knowledge content and refines their work, leading to an updated information state
   - A new round of interaction is then activated, with developers gathering timely, tailored, and evolving information from the coding assistant
4. **Qualified Code or Project Accomplishment**:
   - Developers reach a final information state (sT) where they have accomplished a qualified code or project

## 4 Challenges

**Challenges in Agentic Interactive Reasoning (IR)**

**Data Acquisition:**
- Logged data from agent's interaction with environment
- Determined by user instructions, agent policy, and environment dynamics
- Exploration-exploitation tradeoff crucial for high-quality data collection
- Direct labeling of correct trajectories expensive and challenging

**Model Training:**
- Agent policy consists of DAG of functions: memory update, thought manipulation, tool use
- Effectively updating parameters of these functions and composite policy function highly challenging
- Recent attempts using RFT (Christianos et al., 2023) and action decomposition (Wen et al., 2024)

**Inference Cost:**
- Large parameter size and autoregressive nature increase GPU requirements and processing time for LLMs
