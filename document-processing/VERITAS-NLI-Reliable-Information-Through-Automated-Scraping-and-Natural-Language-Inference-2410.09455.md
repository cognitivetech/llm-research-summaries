## III Methodology

### III-A Training Dataset

**LIAR Dataset for Fake News Detection**

**Source**: Pulitfact.com (POLITIFACT), publicly available resource
- Compiled from PolitiFact, a Pulitzer Prize-winning website
- Multiple human evaluated statements
- Authentication of POLITIFACT editor

**Data**:
- News claims from various multimedia sources: news releases, TV/radio interviews, campaign speeches, advertisements, social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook)
- Societal and government related news topics: economy, taxes, campaign-biography, elections, education, jobs

**Characteristics**:
- Statements collected over a ten-year period
- Each statement accompanied by metadata: speaker, context, detailed judgment report

**Fields in the Dataset**:
1. **Label Description**: Truthfulness rating assigned to each statement
   - Multilabel system: "True", "Mostly True", "Half True", "Barely True", "False", "Pants on Fire"
2. **Label Assignment**: Rationale or explanation for the label assignment by fact-checkers
   - Evidence and reasoning based on research, reports, data analysis
3. **Label Distribution**: Figure 1 illustrates the label distribution in the LIAR dataset

**Preprocessing**:
- Converted 6 classes into two distinct categories (True/False)
- Mitigates subjective disagreements by reducing ambiguity
- Consistent labeling standards: Mapping = { ‚Äútrue‚Äù: True, "mostly-true": True, "half-true": True, "barely-true": False, "false": False, "pants-fire": False}

**Usage**:
- Training of classical machine learning models and transformer-based models for binary classification using the entire transformed LIAR dataset.

### III-B Evaluation Dataset

**Evaluating Model Performance**

**New Dataset for Headline Analysis:**
- Consists of latest headlines from various domains (science, sports, pop culture, politics, business)
- Collected from trusted sources (CNN, USNews, The Guardian, BBC, NYT, Reuters, Times of India, CNBC)

**Dataset Specifications:**
- Contains 346 credible headlines
- Generates corresponding unreliable headlines using Small Language Model (SLM), microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct
- Total of 692 headlines in evaluation dataset

**Unreliable Headline Generation:**
- Prompted to modify reliable headlines through: sentence negation, number swaps, replacing named entities, noise injection
- Resulting in convincing fake news headlines for model evaluation

**Zero-shot Prompt Approach:**
- "Given the true headline, you have to make changes to it using a combination of Sentence negation, Number swaps, Replacing Named Entities and Noise Injection to generate a fake news headline. The output should be only the generated fake news headline."

**Example:**
- Figure 2 shows an example of an unreliable headline generated using Microsoft‚Äôs Phi-3 with our zero-shot prompting approach.

### III-C Classical Model Performance Benchmarks

**Classical Machine Learning Models for Fact-Checking News Articles**

**Preprocessing Steps**:
- **Stopword Removal**: Removing common words with little meaning
- **Token Filtering**: Excluding non-alphabetic tokens
- **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to root form using NLTK's WordNetLemmatizer
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer**: Representing word importance based on frequency in document and corpus

**Classical Machine Learning Models**:
- **Linear SVC**: Support Vector Classifier that finds a hyperplane for maximum distance between classified samples
- **Multinomial Naive-Bayes**: Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem, suitable for document classification
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Ensemble model creating decision trees to improve predictive accuracy
- **Logistic Regression**: Model for modeling relationship between dependent and independent variables, predicting likelihood of group membership

**Transformer Models**:
- **BERT**: Pre-trained model based on Transformer architecture, capturing context of words through left and right contexts
- Fine-tuning BERT on LIAR dataset provides an advantage due to its deep understanding of language patterns and context

**Model Performance Metrics**:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score for models trained and tested on LIAR and Evaluation datasets

**Importance of Transformers**:
- Effectively handle polysemous words with bidirectional context understanding
- Can be fine-tuned with a small number of task-specific examples to achieve high performance

#### BERT Fine-Tuning for Fake News Detection

**Text Normalization:**
- Convert all text to lowercase (for BERT-base-uncased)
- Perform unicode normalization

**Punctuation Splitting:**
- Split the text at punctuation, adding spaces around each punctuation mark

**WordPiece Tokenization:**
- Break words into subword units based on a trained vocabulary
- Unknown words are split into smaller subwords that exist in the vocabulary

**Adding Special Tokens:**
- Add special tokens such as [CLS], [SEP] for specific tasks (e.g., classification, question answering)

**Fine-Tuning:**
- **Initialization**: Fine-tuning begins with pre-trained models initially trained on a large corpus
- **Task-Specific Adjustments**: Tweak the last few layers of the model to align outputs with task requirements
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:**
  - Number of epochs: A single epoch is often sufficient, but using greater numbers can lead to overfitting
  - Batch sizes: Smaller batch sizes help maintain a balance between memory usage and effective learning
  - Warmup steps: Implement a warmup phase at the beginning of training where learning rates are gradually increased
  - Learning rate: The most suitable value for many models is 5e-3 (learing\_rate) and 0.001 (weight\_decay)
  - FP16: Enables faster training and reduced memory usage while maintaining precision

## IV Proposed Solution

**Proposed Solution: VERITAS-NLI**

* VERITAS-NLI utilizes web-scraping, Small Language Models (SLM), and Natural Language Inference (NLI) models to mimic human cognitive processes in evaluating claim reliability.
* Three pipelines - Question-Answer Pipeline, Article Pipeline, and Small Language Model Pipeline - showcase this intuition and demonstrate effectiveness.

### IV-A Web Scraping Techniques

**Web Scraping Techniques for Fact-Checking News Headlines:**
* Retrieve external knowledge using: web scraping, chromedriver, XML Tree traversal
* Approaches to scrape relevant information:**Fact-Based Headline Verification**: check Google Search 'Quick Answer'
  + **Top-K Articles Retrieval**: get titles and contents from top search results
  + **People Also Asked, **SLM Generated Questions**: generate questions using Small Language Models
* Sources used: trusted news outlets, reputable sources
* Scraping rules: follow 'robots.txt' directives to access content responsibly.

### IV-B Question-Answer Pipeline

**Google Search Methods: Amalgamation of Techniques**
- **Quick Answer**: Dependent on whether input headline is a hard fact or not
- Incorporated **"People Also Asked",   - Heavy user interaction dependence for uncommon occurrences
  - May not be represented in the PAA section
- **Terminating fallback**: Naive scraping of top-k articles if previous methods fail

**Scraping and Claim Verification Process (Pipeline #3)**
1. Web scraping
2. Passed scraped content to headline-verifying Natural Language Understanding (NLI) model
3. Input headline is claim (hypothesis), scraped content is premise
4. Model generates prediction and confidence score
5. Represents how well claims in headline are supported by external information.

### IV-C Small Language Model Pipeline

**Small Language Models for Question Generation**
- **Pipeline**: Small Language Models (SLM) used to generate questions for more relevant content scraping
- **Approach**: Identical to Question-Answer Pipeline with an added SLM question generation step
- **Transform**: User entered input headline into a context-aware question using Open Source SLMs: Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 and Microsoft‚Äôs Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct
- **Benefits**: Retrieve more direct answers from the web for fact-checking claims against external sources
- **Question Generation**: Transforms input headline into a question using SLMs to increase probability of obtaining a direct response on the web

**Example Question Generation Prompt**:
- You‚Äôre tasked with fact-checking news headlines for authenticity. Given a headline, generate 1 question that needs to be true to verify its accuracy using a Google search and scrape the answer from the quick search box. Ask the crucial questions first.

**Pipeline 2**: Question Generation Process
- Input headline: "India wins 2023 ICC Men‚Äôs Cricket World Cup"
- Prompt: Generate 1 question that needs to be true to verify the authenticity of this headline using a Google search and scrape the answer from the quick search box.
- Question generated by Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3: "Who won the 2023 ICC Men‚Äôs Cricket World Cup?"
- This question simplifies the scraping workflow and helps retrieve a direct answer to verify the veracity of the claim.

### IV-D Article Pipeline

**Article Pipeline Methodology:**
- Gathers data from online sources systematically using web scraping [[43](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.09455v1#bib.bib43)]
- Extracts relevant content based on Top K links to articles
- Acquires headings and content from these links for verification process
- Structures pipeline efficiently and reliably
- Naive approach leads to more accurate outcomes

**Pipeline Components:**
1. Web scraper: acquires headings and content of articles related to a specific input headline
2. Model: verifies the claim based on retrieved information
3. Natural Language Inference (NLI) models: FactCC [[7](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.09455v1#bib.bib7)] and SummaC [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.09455v1#bib.bib8)] for analyzing potential inconsistencies within claimed headlines

**Benefits:**
- Efficient and reliable process
- Rich contextual understanding of topic at hand from article content
- Improves model performance compared to incomplete or misguiding summaries like 'Quick Answer' and 'People Also Asked'

**Improved Results:**
- Scraping right amount of information (quantity to quality) leads to best output correlation.

### IV-E NLI-based Models for Headline Inconsistency Detection

**FactCC Approach for Ensuring Factually Consistent Summaries:**
- **VERITAS-NLI**: leverages FactCC [[7](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.09455v1#bib.bib7)], a model ensuring factual consistency in text summarization
- **Architecture of FactCC**: built upon BERT, operates under weakly-supervised learning framework, trained on synthetic data, and uses multi-task learning for Consistency Identification, Support Extraction, and Error Localization
- **Impact on Text Summarization**: ensures that generated summaries remain factually consistent with their source documents

**Comparison of Headline and Source Text:**
- Inconsistencies detected using **Natural Language Inference (NLI)** models: Entailment, Contradiction, or Neutral
- NLI models perform well thanks to large training datasets like MNLI [[52](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.09455v1#bib.bib52)], SNLI [[53](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.09455v1#bib.bib53)], and VitaminC [[54](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.09455v1#bib.bib54)]
- Modern attention-based architectures exhibit human performance for this task [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.09455v1#bib.bib8)]

**FactCC Output:**
- Input Headline, generated question(s), retrieved article or direct answer, and NLI-Model Output Score are presented for comparison
- Example of correct outputs: Max Verstappen wins 2023 F1 world title -> Entailment (or high NLI score)

**SummaC Approach:**
- Obtains state-of-the-art results for inconsistency detection in summarization of documents
- Segments longer documents into sentence units, changing the granularity at which NLI models are applied
- Calculates likelihood of relationships between each summary and document-sentence pair using an NLI model
- Aggregates these scores to produce final output: SummaC-ZS (maximum value per column) or SummaC-Conv (1D-convolution on histograms)
- Determines optimal decision threshold for binary predictions through calibration process.
