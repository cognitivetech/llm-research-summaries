## 2. Why Data-centric AI?

A shift from algorithm-centric to data-centric AI is underway. The recognition that data is key to successful AI models is driving this change. Let's explore why data-centric AI is gaining attention and transforming the field.

### 2.1 Understanding the Problem: Kaggle's Insight

**Kaggle and Data Science Community**
- **Kaggle**: widely recognized for machine learning competitions
- Reflects changing trends in data science community utilizing AI

**Hypothesis:**
- In Kaggle community, individuals attribute their success more to models used rather than the data they process

**Testing Hypothesis:**
- Analyzed **meta Kaggle dataset** [[2](https://www.kaggle.com/code/muhammadirfanakbar/data-centric-ai-the-underdog-game-changer-in-ai#7.2)]
- Contrast observed between topics discussed in forums and winners' write-ups (Fig.1)

**Findings:**
- Stark contrast between word count of terminologies in winners' write-ups and forum discussions
- Despite prevalence of data-related discussions in forums, success attributed more to models in winners' write-ups
- Lower word count for data-related terms in winners' write-ups compared to forums, indicating that models often outshine data in attribution of success.

**Fig.1.** Comparison of Frequent Word used between Winner's Writeup and Forum Discussion

**Implications:**
- Data-centric challenges often cause significant difficulties but spotlight frequently received by models
- Simplicity can often outperform complexity in data processing, especially with proper handling and quality of data (Philosophy of data-centric AI).

### 2.2 The ~~Art~~ Science of Data Techniques

**Importance of High-Quality Data for AI Models**
- A state-of-the-art model with poor quality data will yield subpar results
- **High-quality data** is a non-negotiable ingredient in successful AI models
- Securing high-quality data is challenging:
  - Each dataset brings its own challenges
  - Data preparation requires careful management
    - Collection and preprocessing
    - Feature engineering and data augmentation

**Art vs. Science of Data Analysis**
- Data analysis involves both art and science
- **Qualitative data** requires careful interpretation, like creating a narrative
- Presenting data is an artistic endeavor to tell a clear story
- Data analysis is often exploratory, probing and refining the data

**Shift Towards Data-Centric AI**
- Data-centric AI is shifting the field towards more systematic and empirical approach
- Traditional data augmentation was intuitive, now systematized with comprehensive papers
- Other aspects of data preprocessing are also seeing scientific transformations

**Fig.2. The Systematic Diagram of Data Augmentation**

- The [diagram](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1uN8PhreE73eJ07UBe4teyOUYv0_PYpUA) illustrates the systematic way of carrying out data augmentation, irrespective of data shape.

## 3. Tasks in Data-centric AI

The operational framework of data-centric AI is non-linear and consists of three interdependent tasks: Training Data Development, Inference Data Development, and Data Maintenance, which can be addressed concurrently.

### 3.1 Training Data Development

**Training Data Development**

**Process**:
- Collection: gathering data from various sources
- Labeling: assigning tags or categories to data points
- Preparation: cleaning, transforming, and formatting data for machine learning
- Reduction: reducing the size of data to improve performance and reduce computational requirements
- Augmentation: generating new data by applying transformations, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping

**Importance**:
- High-quality input data essential for accurate and reliable output from models
- "Garbage in, garbage out" principle applies
- Ensures machine learning models learn meaningful patterns.

**Fig.3.** (from [[5]](https://www.kaggle.com/code/muhammadirfanakbar/data-centric-ai-the-underdog-game-changer-in-ai#7.5)) illustrates the training data development process:

### 3.2 Inference Data Development

**Data-Centric AI (DCAI)**
* Inference data: unseen data used to evaluate model performance
* Model evaluation focuses on providing finer details beyond just metrics
* Importance of effective models on unseen data

**Inference Data Development:**
1. **In-distribution Evaluation**: assesses model's performance on similar training data distributions
2. **Out-distribution Evaluation**: measures how well the model performs on divergent data from training distribution
* Autonomous vehicles as real-world application: encountering unfamiliar routes = Out-distribution evaluation
3. **Prompt Engineering**: devising effective inputs to obtain desired outputs from models

**Out-distribution Evaluation:**
* Example in autonomous vehicles: navigating unfamiliar routes (Fig.4)
* Model may not have encountered such data during training

**Prompt Engineering:**
* Crucial aspect of data-centric AI
* Art and science of crafting optimal prompts for desired outputs.

### 3.3 Data Maintenance

Real-world data evolves dynamically, not like Kaggle's static datasets. Data Maintenance ensures continuous processing and integration of this influx, keeping training data updated. This process is called Continual Learning, enabling AI systems to adapt to changing data and maintain accuracy. Together, these tasks form the foundation of a data-centric AI approach.

## 4. Recent Advancement in Data-centric AI

Data-centric AI has grown rapidly due to breakthroughs in various fields over the past two years. Some key developments highlight the shift towards a data-centric approach.

### 4.1 Prompt Engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Text-to-Image Models-and-Text-to-Image-Models)

**Prompt Engineering**:
- Gained significant traction in recent years
- Importance of optimizing inputs to maximize model performance
- Accessible LLMs like ChatGPT and text-to-image models (e.g., Dall-E, Stable Diffusion) require prompt engineering to enhance efficiency

**Value of Prompt Engineering**:
