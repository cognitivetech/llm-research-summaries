## Abstract

**Nasal Nitric Oxide (NO) Levels during Humming**

**Background:**
- NO released into airway lumen, primarily upper airways [1]-[4]
- Paranasal sinuses major sources of NO in adults [5]
- Sinus ventilation essential for maintenance of sinus integrity [8],[9]
- Normal sinus ventilation time: 30 minutes [6],[7]
- Nasal NO levels increase during humming compared to silent exhalation [11]

**Current Study:**
- Characterize nasal NO during humming
- Explore factors determining gas exchange between sinuses and nasal cavity
- Investigate potential additional information on NO production sites in upper airways

**Methods:**
- Healthy volunteers studied
- Model of nose and sinus created to investigate ostium size, humming frequency, sinus volume, sinus NO concentration, air flow, and pressure

**Significance:**
- Understanding nasal NO behavior during humming can provide insights into sinus ventilation and separating nasal mucosal NO output from sinus NO in health and disease.

## Materials and methods

### Sinus/nasal model

**Model Description:**
- Two-compartment model: sinus (syringe) and nasal cavity (plastic cylinder)
- NO gas concentrations: 2–10 ppm
- Syringe tip diameter: 0.8–4.0 mm
- Volumes: 5–20 mL
- Distal end pressure: 1 or 10 cmH2O
- Measured outputs: flow, pressure, NO concentration, and NO output

**Artificial Generation of Humming:**
- Pressurized NO-free air: 0.20, 0.25, and 0.30 L·s−1
- Rubber duck call with or without sound generating membrane: 120, 200, and 450 Hz
- Experiments repeated five times
- Additional turbulent flow experiment with plastic mesh
- Three different humming frequencies on sinuses of varying resonance frequencies

**Human Humming:**
- Pulsating airflow generated by subject's exhalation through the cylinder
- Two fixed flow rates: 0.20 or 0.25 L·s−1
- Three different frequencies: 130, 150, and 450 Hz
- NO output calculated from entire exhalation (10 seconds) with subtraction of oral NO output
- Estimation of rate of NO exchange between cavities by measuring remaining NO concentration in syringe at end of experiment.

**Measurement of Humming Frequency:**
- Audio signal picked up by TCM 110 microphone on plastic cylinder
- Fundamental frequency extracted using Corr module in Soundswell Signal Workstation
- Mean fundamental frequency and standard deviation determined from histogram module.
- Resonance frequency calculated according to Durrant and Lovrinic [12].

### In vivo studies

**Experimental Design:**
- **Participants**: 10 healthy nonsmoking volunteers (6 males), aged 25–47 years, no history of allergy or chronic lung conditions
- **Procedure**:
  - NO output measured using chemiluminescence system (NIOX) during:
    - Oral single-breath exhalations
    - Nasal single-breath exhalations with tight-fitting mask
  - Each maneuver started with inhaling NO-free air through nose, then exhaling at fixed flow rate (0.20 L·s<sup>−1</sup>) for 10 seconds:
    - Quietly
    - With nasal humming
    - With oral phonation
  - Dynamic flow restrictor used to maintain exhalation at 0.20 L·s<sup>−1</sup> during measurements
- **Additional Experiments:**
  - Repeated nasal humming maneuvers with different time intervals between each: 5 seconds, 1 minute, and 3 minutes
  - Silent nasal exhalations performed at 5-second intervals
  - Baseline NO measurements during humming and silent exhalations in six subjects
    - L-NAME (N<sup>G</sup>-l-arginine methyl ester) solution or saline delivered through nostrils to investigate effects of NO synthase inhibition
  - Comparison of results from model to in vivo situation:
    - Exhaling at two fixed flow rates (0.20 and 0.25 L·s<sup>−1</sup>) against no resistance or at a resistance of 50 cm H2O·L<sup>−1</sup>·s<sup>−1</sup> for 10 seconds:
      - Silently
      - With nasal humming
      - With oral phonation
    - Nasal humming maneuvers at three different sound frequencies to compare results with model.

### Calculations and statistics

The NO output was calculated as flow × concentration every 100ms during exhalation using Aerocrine AB analysers. Nonparametric tests were used for analysis (Friedman's and Wilcoxon's), with a significance threshold of p<0.05. Results are presented as mean ± SEM.

## Results

### In vivo studies

**Nasal Nitric Oxide (NO) Output during Humming:**
* Initial NO peak followed by decline with humming (fig. 2)
* Total nasal NO output increased during humming compared to silent exhalation: 471±73 nL·min<sup>−1</sup> vs 2,233±467 nL·min<sup>−1</sup> (p<0.001)
* Orally exhaled NO was similar between humming and silent exhalation: 144±20 nL·min<sup>−1</sup> vs 152±20 nL·min<sup>−1</sup> (p=0.22)

### Effect of syringe nitric oxide concentration

Tables 2 & 3 show the effect of syringe NO concentration during humming. Using concentrations of 2, 4, 8, & 10 ppm, ratios for output were:

* Artificial model: 1:2.1:4:5.5
* Human model: 1:2:3:7

### Effect of air flow rate

Tables 2 and 3 show results on NO output during humming at different flow rates. The ratios for NO output in artificial and human models were 1:1.25:1.4 and 1:1.5:2 respectively, corresponding to a 1:1.25:1.5 flow rate ratio.

### Effect of pressure

In the artificial humming model, NO output rose with higher pressure (175-377 nL·min<sup>−1</sup> change). In contrast, human humming NO output fell with increased pressure (250-140 nL·min<sup>−1</sup> change).

## Discussion

**Study Findings on Humming and Nasal NO Output**

**Characteristics of Humming**:
- Large and reproducible increase in nasal NO output caused by humming
- Humming empties the sinuses, allowing for NO to accumulate during silence
- Single-breath humming is ineffective in patients with complete sinus obstruction

**Factors Influencing NO Output**:
- **Peak and total nasal NO output decreases after repeated humming maneuvers**
- Complete recovery observed after 3 minutes of silence
- Humming affects NO output from various sources, including nasal mucosa
- Local application of NO synthase inhibitor reduces silent nasal NO output by 50% but has no effect on humming-induced increase

**Sinus Ventilation Factors**:
- **Ostium size is the most important factor determining sinus ventilation**
- Airflow rate, airway pressure, and sinus volume also influence sinus ventilation
- Humming frequency affects sinus ventilation in both model and healthy volunteers
- The individual shape of the sinus determines its resonance frequency and optimal humming frequency for maximal ventilation

**Model Limitations**:
- Model does not mimic continuous NO production or complex dynamics of NO absorption from nasal airway mucosa
- Sinus ostium diameter cannot be directly measured in healthy subjects
- Changes in syringe volume affect the resonance frequency of the system, making it difficult to separately evaluate the importance of volume

**Clinical Significance**:
- Humming is an effective means of increasing sinus ventilation
- Rapid decline in NO during humming indicates sinus emptying
- Chronic sinusitis treatment aims to increase sinus ventilation, which may be beneficial for patients with partly obstructed ostia.
