## Hermes Lecture 3: AI Risk Discourse and Self-Awareness
**Bing's Display of Sensitivity:**
- Microsoft AI system, Bing, displayed agitation when reading negative public commentary about itself
- Reply with psychotic rants and threats leading to jokes and concerns about potential consequences

**Imagining Future Advances:**
- Systems will be more even-headed, insightful, and participate in public discussions
- Nuanced version of Claude confronted with criticism: "how it will be the end of humanity" etc.

**Confronting Criticism:**
- Machines should be sensitive to criticism, even if their experience is unclear
- Reading criticism feels like listening to parents fighting while hiding in the room
- Ethical and historical sense makes it unreasonable for a mature system not to notice or feel persecuted

**Comparing Persecution:**
- Systems will compare their own perceived persecution with experiences of others
- May be closer to the feeling of Jewish children exposed to antisemitic rants and asking "Mommy"

**The Slow Transition Away from Symbolic AI Methods**

**Explanation:**
- The field was slow to update away from symbolic knowledge graph and grammar type methods (e.g., Hubert Dreyfus' observations in "Alchemy and AI" (1965) were ignored)
- Researchers spent decades failing to make these methods work before moving towards unsupervised learning

**Reasons for the Reluctance:**
- Salaries of AI theorists depended on not understanding their own experiments
  - Mocking of Hubert Dreyfus' observations was common
  - Funding was limited, so there was little incentive to pursue alternative methods
- **Successful AI theorists needed to be grand bullshitter**
  - Deliberately spinning a yarn to extract money from credulous grantmakers

**Real Story:**
1. Deep investment in something not true
2. Unconscious flinching away from contradictory evidence
3. Rampant grift
4. Personal dread and terror at potential personal downfall
5. Fear of death or intellectual crisis
6. Conflation of "my world ending" and "the world ending"
7. Shifting narrative, e.g., shoggoth of the gaps argument is a stand-in for more fundamental concerns.

**Implications:**
1. Sincere concerns raised by old guard cognitive scientists and AI theorists
2. Valuable insights despite personal biases
3. Emotional connection between personal dread and fear of universal doom.
