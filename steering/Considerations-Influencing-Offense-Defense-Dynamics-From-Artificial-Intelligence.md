## 3 Offense-Defense Dynamics Taxonomy

To analyze AI's impact on offense and defense, we introduce the Offense-Defense Dynamics Framework. This taxonomy consists of six elements that shape the spread and influence of AI in a given context:

1. Accessibility and Control
2. Proliferation, Diffusion, and Release Methods
3. Safeguards and Mitigations

### 3.1 Raw Capability Potential

**Raw Capability Potential**

**Definition**:
- Represents the inherent abilities of an AI system to perform actions that can be used offensively or defensively
- Refers to the fundamental power of the AI system to harm or protect societal assets, infrastructure, individuals, or the biosphere, based solely on its technical capacities
- Focuses on what an AI system can do at a fundamental level, without considering its current usage or any protective measures in place

**Importance in Offense-Defense Dynamics**:
- The raw capabilities of an AI system set the baseline for both its potential benefits and risks
- Advanced capabilities enable sophisticated defensive measures, such as enhanced threat detection and response
- But also increase the potential for offensive applications, like automated cyber-attacks or the creation of disinformation at scale

**Two Primary Dimensions**:
- **Capabilities Breadth**:
  - Refers to the range of tasks and domains an AI system can operate in
  - Encompasses its versatility and expertise across domains and modalities
  - Examples: Large language model capable of various tasks
- **Capabilities Depth**:
  - Refers to the level of sophistication and effectiveness an AI system demonstrates within specific domains
  - Describes how advanced and capable a system is in its particular area of focus
  - Examples: AI system designed for protein folding prediction (AlphaFold)

**Combination of Breadth and Depth**:
- Systems can exhibit various combinations of breadth and depth, producing multiple gradients of potential capabilities
- Models can be simultaneously broad and deep, amplifying their potential influence on offense-defense balances.

### 3.2 Accessibility and Control

**Accessibility and Control**

**Definition**:
- Refers to who can access, use, and operate an AI system
- Includes user authentication, licensing for use, and control mechanisms
- Determines who can interact with the AI system as it currently exists
- Consideration of whether other AI systems can access or interface with it

**Importance in Offense-Defense Dynamics**:
- Accessibility and control significantly influence an AI system's potential for beneficial use and misuse
- Widely accessible systems with minimal control may be more susceptible to exploitation
- Restricted access can limit defensive applications but also reduce unauthorized use
- Balancing accessibility and control is essential to maximize societal benefits while minimizing risks

**Access Level**:
- Includes considerations of an AI system's access level (public, restricted or confidential), access type (open source, proprietary with public API or closed system), and access cost (low, medium or high)
- Examples:
  - Open-source language model LLAMA is highly accessible but also lowers the barrier to offensive applications
  - Disparities in access can influence defensive measures and amplify vulnerabilities for entities or populations with limited AI access

**Interaction Complexity**:
- Refers to the range and sophistication of ways users and systems can engage with an AI model within its existing configuration
- Includes single query-response interactions, multi-turn dialogues, task completion, and granularity of input/output control
- Lower interaction complexity can limit potential misuse but also restrict capabilities for sophisticated applications
- Higher interaction complexity can enable more sophisticated applications but also increase the potential for unintended uses

### 3.3 Adaptability

**Adaptability of Artificial Intelligence Systems:**
* **Definition:** Adaptability refers to an AI system's capacity for modification, customization or repurposing beyond its original context or intended use.
* **Factors Influencing Adaptability:**
  + Accessibility of model weights and fine-tuning capabilities
  + Feasibility of model distillation or knowledge transfer
  + Presence of modular components for independent updating/replacement
* **Importance in Offense-Defense Dynamics:**
  + High adaptability allows swift repurposing, beneficial for defensive measures but also risks misuse
  + Adaptability impacts likelihood of unintended consequences and vulnerabilities
* **Dimensions of Adaptability:**
  * **Modifiability:**
    - Ease of altering an AI system through fine-tuning and modular architectures
    - Allows model modification for specific offensive/defensive applications (e.g., threat detection, generating content)
  * **Knowledge Transferability:**
    - Ability of a system to transfer learned knowledge to new tasks, domains or models
    - Enables rapid adaptation without extensive retraining and enhances overall adaptability in various scenarios.

### 3.4 Proliferation, Diffusion, and Release Methods

**Proliferation, Diffusion, and Release Methods of AI Systems**

**Importance in Offense-Defense Dynamics**:
- Affects rate and extent of AI adoption for both offensive and defensive purposes

- Controlled release limits access but may slow down beneficial adoption

**Dimensions Influencing Offense-Defense Dynamics:**
1. **Distribution Control**:
   - Release method (open-source, open weights, closed-source)
   - Degree of control over distribution
   - Phased release: high control, e.g., GPT-4
   - Open release: low control, e.g., BLOOM
2. **Model Reach and Integration**:
   - Ease of deployment across platforms and integration into systems
   - Factors affecting reach: model size, hardware compatibility, software ecosystems

- Enhance defensive utility by ensuring responsible use of advanced AI technologies

**Safeguards and Mitigations Taxonomy:**

**Technical Safeguards:**
- Content filtering mechanisms
- Behavioral alignment techniques
- Output limitations
  * Examples: models with robust technical safeguards can refuse harmful outputs, such as explicit content or dangerous information

**Monitoring and Auditing:**
- Real-time usage monitoring practices
- Periodic safety audits
- Implementation of accountability taxonomies
  * Instances: rigorous safety audits before public release, controlled API access with robust output monitoring for early detection and prevention of potential misuse.

### 3.6 Sociotechnical Context

**Sociotechnical Context: Understanding the Broader Environment for AI Operations and Interactions**
* The Sociotechnical Context refers to the technological, social, and political environment in which AI systems operate and interact
* Includes regulatory frameworks, public awareness, geopolitical tensions, and robustness of technological infrastructure

**Importance in Offense-Defense Dynamics:**
* The sociotechnical context can amplify or mitigate risks associated with AI technologies
* A supportive environment with robust regulations, international cooperation, and high public awareness can enhance defensive applications and responsible use
* A hostile context marked by geopolitical tensions, ineffective regulations, and low public awareness can increase the likelihood of proliferation of offensive applications and misuse of AI technologies

**Assessing Sociotechnical Context:**
* Two main dimensions: Geopolitical Stability and Regulatory Strength

**Geopolitical Stability:**
- International cooperation, conflicts and tensions, global power dynamics in AI development
- Influences motivations for developing offensive or defensive AI capabilities and affects collaboration on AI governance
- Increasing geopolitical tensions could lead to an arms race scenario, potentially prioritizing offensive applications over safety considerations

**Regulatory Strength:**
- Maturity and effectiveness of regulatory taxonomies on AI
- Capacity for enforcement
- Strong regulations and enforcement can mitigate risks by setting standards for responsible development and use, while weak regulations may allow harmful applications to proliferate
- For example: The European Union's proposed AI Act aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory taxonomy for AI systems, potentially enhancing safety and ethical standards while possibly slowing down dangerous and offense-dominant AI applications compared to regions with less stringent regulations.
