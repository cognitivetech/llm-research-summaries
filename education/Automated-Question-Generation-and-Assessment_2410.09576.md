### 2.2 The Role of Fine-Tuning and Prompt-Tuning

**LLMs for Educational Question Generation and Assessment**

**Techniques Used**:
- **Fine-tuning**:
  - Involves training the LLM on a specialized dataset closely aligned with the target task
  - Allows the model to learn nuances of educational content and generate questions more aligned with curriculum
- **Prompt-tuning**:
  - Involves designing prompts that guide the LLM in generating desired output
  - Leverages model's existing knowledge and directs it towards generating contextually relevant, pedagogically valuable questions
  - Example: Prompt instructing LLM to generate a question based on specific passage of text, focusing on key concepts

**Advantages and Challenges**:
- **Fine-tuning**:
  - Produces highly specialized models excelling in specific tasks
  - Resource-intensive and requires large, high-quality datasets
- **Prompt-tuning**:
  - More flexible and less resource-demanding
  - Relies on effective prompt design and may not achieve same level of specificity as fine-tuned models

**Performance**:
- Both techniques have shown significant promise in enhancing LLMs' performance in educational settings.

## 3 Automated Question Generation: Methodologies and Techniques

### 3.1 Generating Diverse and Contextually Relevant Questions

**Automated Question Generation Using Large Language Models (LLMs)**
- **Benefits**: Enables creation of diverse, contextually relevant questions tailored to various learning objectives [[Maity et al. (2024a)]]

**Methods Used in Question Generation:**
1. **Zero-Shot Prompting**:
   - Allows GPT-3 to generate questions based on minimal instructions
   - Leverages pre-trained knowledge without additional examples or fine-tuning [[Brown et al. (2020)]]
   - Useful for generating questions across wide range of topics but quality may vary [[Maity et al. (2023), 2024b]]
2. **Few-Shot Prompting**:
   - Provides model with a few examples to guide question generation
   - Enhances model's understanding of task and improves relevance and quality [[Brown et al. (2020)]]
3. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**:
   - Structured technique guiding LLM through reasoning process before generating final question
   - Effective for generating higher-order questions requiring critical thinking and analysis [[Wei et al. (2022), Maity et al. (2024d)]]
4. **Fine-Tuning**:
   - Further trains LLM on specific dataset of questions and answers
   - Results in highly specialized models generating accurate, context-specific questions [[Raffel et al. (2020), Maity et al. (2023)]]
5. **Prompt-Tuning**:
   - Adjusts a small set of parameters while leaving the rest unchanged
   - Effective in generating high-quality questions across various educational contexts [[Lester et al. (2021)]]
6. **Multiformat and Multilingual Question Generation:**
   - LLMs can generate both open-ended and multiple-choice questions, catering to different assessment needs
   - Open-ended encourages critical thinking; multiple-choice evaluates specific knowledge or skills [[Maity et al. (2024d)]]
   - Multilingual capabilities enable generation of questions in various languages for cross-cultural education [[Radford et al. (2019), Maity et al. (2024d)]]
7. **Continued Evolution**: As LLMs evolve, integration of these techniques will further improve relevance, accuracy, and utility of automated question generation in education.

### 3.2 Types of Questions Generated by LLMs

**Educational Question Types and Their Functions:**

**Factual Questions:**
- Focus on recall of specific information (dates, definitions, events)
- Assess memory and basic understanding
- Examples: "What is the capital of France?", "When was the Declaration of Independence signed?"

**Open-Ended Questions:**
- Encourage deep thinking and exploration
- Allow students to express thoughts freely
- Promote critical thinking and discussion
- Do not have single correct answer
- Examples: "What is purchasing power parity?", "How does climate change impact agriculture?"

**Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs):**
- Assess specific knowledge or skills
- Provide set of possible answers, one correct
- Widely used for testing and grading efficiency
- Examples: "Which of the following is the largest planet in our solar system? (a) Earth (b) Jupiter (c) Mars (d) Venus"

**Language Models (LLMs):**
- Capable of generating varied question types effectively
- Adapt to different educational contexts and learning objectives.
