## Abstract
**Background:**
- ChatGPT has been used in education for learning, teaching, and research
- Potential to conduct Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) but limited empirical studies on how to use it effectively for this purpose

**Research Objectives:**
1. To what extent can ChatGPT conduct SLR?
2. What strategies can human researchers utilize to structure prompts for ChatGPT that enhance reliability and validity of a SLR?

**Methods:**
- Conducted a SLR using ChatGPT on the same 33 papers as a benchmark
- Design-based approach: compared results from ChatGPT's review with those of published research

**Findings:**
- ChatGPT could conduct a SLR, but requires detailed and accurate prompts to analyze the literature effectively
- Guiding principles summarized for researchers conducting SLRs using ChatGPT.

## Introduction

**Systematic Literature Review (SLR)**
- A research methodology to collect, identify, and critically analyze studies through a systematic procedure
- Advances evidence-based knowledge by synthesizing common themes and trends over time
- Identifies research gaps for future studies
- Highly labour intensive and time-consuming task in framing clear research questions and developing analysis strategies

**ChatGPT**
- Developed by OpenAI as an advancement in natural language processing and artificial intelligence
- Originated from the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture, with GPT-3 being a notable predecessor
- Designed to improve interaction with AI and offer conversational dialogue, question answering, and content generation
- Utilizes deep learning techniques to understand and generate human-like text based on input
- Significant enhancements in understanding, context awareness, and generative abilities from GPT-3 to ChatGPT 4.0
- Promising potential for education applications such as designing quizzes, promoting active learning, strengthening collaborative learning, providing immediate feedback, serving as a writing assistant, and assisting with data analysis research.

**Benefits of using ChatGPT in Education:**
1. Design quizzes (Eysenbach, 2023; Jahic et al., 2023)
2. Promote active learning (Shoufan, 2023)
3. Strengthen collaborative learning (Cotton et al., 2023)
4. Provide immediate feedback and personalized learning (Kuhail et al., 2022)
5. Serve as writing assistant (Jahic et al., 2023)
6. Help with data analysis in research (Hwang & Chen, 2023; Kooli, 2023)

**Challenges of using ChatGPT in Education:**
1. Lack of ability to generate original ideas and critical thinking (Arif et al., 2023; Choi et al., 2023; Kooli, 2023)
2. Learning process changes (Qi et al., 2023)
3. Misinterpretation in research (Kooli, 2023)
4. Ethical issues: authorship in academic writing and plagiarism (da Silva, 2023; Zhang & Zhen, 2023)

**Suggestions for using ChatGPT in Education:**
1. Correct prompts to generate answers (Thakur et al., 2023)
2. Develop learners' new digital skills and competencies (Kasneci et al., 2023).

## Methodology

**ChatGPT-4.0 Study on Blended Synchronous Learning (BSL)**

**Methodology**:
- Exploratory study to investigate ChatGPT's ability to conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) equivalent to an original literature review (OLR)
- OLR involved systematic selection of 33 papers and analysis/synthesis, based on research questions:
  1. Challenges causing low engagement in BSL for online learners?
  2. Strategies to address challenges and increase online learner engagement?

### Round 1
**Process**:
1. Initial prompt: Researcher uploaded 1st paper, instructing ChatGPT on the two research questions
2. Generation of results: ChatGPT summarized strategies, indicating potential for SLR
3. Analysis of multiple papers: Researcher asked ChatGPT to generate common challenges and strategies after analyzing 5, then 12 papers
4. Results analysis: Generated results had some inaccuracies; researchers identified the need for a more structured approach

**Iterative Process**:
- Round 1: Identical process as OLR, ChatGPT initially generated accurate but broad results (challenges and strategies) from entire document, not just Results section
- Round 2: Researchers requested specific framework and detailed information for common challenges and strategies

**Results and Analysis**:
- Generated results were not accurate, as they included information from the "Literature" section instead of just the "Results"
- ChatGPT captured broad information but did not report findings based on a specific analytical framework used in OLR process. Researchers identified the need for more structured approach to address these issues and conduct a more accurate SLR in subsequent rounds.

### Round 2

**Issue 1:**
- Prompts adjusted by narrowing focus to specific sections (e.g., "Finding/Results" section) using page ranges
- GPT able to address challenges and strategies related to online learning engagement

**Issue 2:**
- Common challenges and strategies based on interaction framework categorized as learner-instructor, learner-learner, learner-content
- ChatGPT had difficulty identifying correct page numbers for all papers; provided PDF file starting points instead
- Generated limited common challenges and strategies in each theme (e.g., increased cognitive load for instructors)
- Added checkpoints to see if ChatGPT could generate richer results

**Issue 3:**
- Overview generated by ChatGPT on educational contexts, research methods, design frameworks compared to OLR results:
  - Some items highly consistent (e.g., graduate level)
  - Big differences in other areas (e.g., K-12 education, DBR, Framework)
  - Inaccurate identification of research methods and theoretical frameworks used in studies.

### Round 3

**Revised Process: Round 3+**
- Two additional checkpoints added between papers 12th and 33rd to generate richer challenges and strategies
- Revised prompt for ChatGPT to provide actual page numbers from the journal, not PDF files
- Common challenges and strategies based on learner-learner, learner-content, learner-instructor interaction framework
- Examples of challenges and strategies provided for each theme (Technological Limitations and Interference)

**Results and Analysis:**
- More common challenges and strategies generated after analyzing 18th and 25th papers
- Final review results after analyzing 33 papers highly consistent with previous OLR results
- ChatGPT provided concrete examples to illustrate summarized themes (Figure 12)

**Issue:**
- Page numbers in ChatGPT's responses were still incorrect, often referring to PDF file names instead of journal page numbers. For example: "Conklina.pdf" (Page 6) is actually page 22 in the journal.

## Discussion

**Study Discussion:**
* Exploratory study on using ChatGPT for systematic literature reviews (SLR)
* Confirms ChatGPT can assist in SLR: analyzing papers, extracting info, summarizing findings
* Limitations: researchers screen papers, no access to academic databases or accurate page number identification
* Guiding principles: screen papers using PRISMA protocol, provide detailed instructions, define research questions and frameworks, check page numbers manually, document process, let ChatGPT read multiple times for accuracy.

## Conclusion
**Key Findings:**
* ChatGPT can help conduct a tentative literature review but has limitations
* Importance of human oversight in the screening process and manual checks for accuracy

**Design Principles:**
1. Screen reviewed papers first, using PRISMA protocol or other methods
2. Provide detailed instructions with clear steps
3. Define research questions and theoretical frameworks
4. Specify page number ranges or sections of papers for analysis
5. Check actual page numbers manually
6. Document the research process to maintain records and ensure accuracy
7. Let ChatGPT read papers repeatedly and triangulate with human beings for enhanced efficiency and reliability.
