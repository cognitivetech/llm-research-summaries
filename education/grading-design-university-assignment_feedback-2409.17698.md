## Abstract
**Study Aims:**
- Investigate if GPT-4 can effectively grade design university assignments and provide useful feedback
- Design projects have subjective nature, leading to grading inconsistencies between raters
- Employ iterative research approach to develop a Custom GPT for reliable results

**Findings:**
1. **Inter-reliability**: Between GPT and human raters reached acceptable level by providing accurate prompts and iterating a Custom GPT
2. **Intra-reliability**: Consistency of GPT's scoring is between 0.65 and 0.78, indicating reliable results with adequate instructions
3. **Comparability and consistency:** A precondition for educational assessment; Custom GPT adheres to these rules
4. **Useful feedback**: Tested whether Custom GPT can provide students with constructive feedback
5. **Educator's role:** Reflecting on how educators can develop and iterate a Custom GPT as a complementary rater.

## 3. Research methods

**Study Background**
- Conducted in a design thinking course at a university in Singapore for first-year students
- Observed that engineering instructors and architecture instructors gave different advice, leading to student confusion on how to balance feedback
- Researchers used ChatGPT-4 to grade design assignments of 10 students (20 posters)
- Employed Design-Based Research (DBR) approach: multiple iterations, prototypes, and testing for continuous refinement

**Study Process**
- **Part I:** Comparison without role-play
  - 1st iteration: General GPT grades assignments
  - 2nd iteration: ChatGPT-4 with instructor rubrics
  - 3rd iteration: Custom GPT using good example as benchmark

- **Part II:** Comparison with role-play instructions
  - 1st iteration: General GPT for grading (no role-play)
  - 2nd iteration: ChatGPT-4 for grading with rubrics (role-play)
  - 3rd iteration: Custom GPT, added rubrics and a good example (role-play)

- **Part III:** Intra-reliability of GPT assessment
  - Checked if custom GPT evaluates assignments consistently over time

**Research Questions**
1. Can ChatGPT accurately grade students' design course assignments?
2. Under what conditions can a Custom ChatGPT act as a reliable grader to serve as a complementary rater?

**Assumptions**
- Assumption 1: Inter-reliability increases progressively in Part I without role-play
- Assumption 2: Inter-reliability increases progressively in Part II with role-play
- Assumption 3: Custom ChatGPT has an intra-reliability greater than 0.5 when scoring the same assignment at different times.

## 4. Findings

### 4.1 (Part I) Inter-Reliability between GPT and Instructors without Role-Playing

**1st Iteration:**
- General GPT process: Graded student assignments using three dimensions - Design goal, Site drawing, MacroAEIOU
- Compared to instructor reliability: Low inter-reliability between Architect Instructor and Engineer Instructor (0.167)
- Comparison with GPT: Inter-reliability was slightly higher with Engineer instructor (average scores of two instructors at 0.473), but still below 0.5

**2nd Iteration:**
- Custom GPT model built using rubrics provided by instructors
- Researchers used screenshots and custom-GPT for scoring assignments with feedback based on rubrics
- Improved inter-reliability between GPT and both instructors (Architect Instructor: 0.5803, Engineer Instructor: 0.5803)
- Inter-reliability with average scores of two instructors also improved (0.5672)

**3rd Iteration:**
- Revised instructions to Custom-GPT by giving it a good example for reference
- Improved inter-reliability between GPT and both instructors further: Architect Instructor (0.7652), Engineer Instructor (0.7652)
- Inter-reliability with average scores of two instructors reached 0.7285, meeting high-stakes exam requirements.

**Assumptions:**
- In iterations without role-playing (Part I), inter-reliability increases progressively.

### 4.2 (Part II) Inter-reliability between GPT and human raters with role-play

**First Iteration: General GPT with Role-play Process**
* Let General GPT grade students' assignments from architect instructor and engineer instructor perspectives
* Inter-reliability between Architect GPT and Architect Instructor: **0.1874**, poor reliability
* Inter-reliability between Engineer GPT and Engineer Instructor: **0.5423**, moderate reliability
* Inter-reliability between two GPts: **0.5407**, moderate reliability
* Comparison of ICC Reliability for Iteration 1 (Part II with role-playing) in Table 4

**Second Iteration: Custom GPT (with rubrics added, with role-playing)**
* Added rubrics used by both instructors and conducted role-play to score from their perspectives
* Inter-reliability between Architect GPT and Architect Instructor: **0.5150**, moderate reliability +**0.2068**
* Inter-reliability between Engineer GPT and Engineer Instructor: **0.7652**, high reliability -**0.3024**
* Inter-reliability between two GPts: **0.5407** - **0.0132**, moderate reliability
* Comparison of ICC Reliability for Iteration 2 (Part II with role-playing) in Table 5

**Third Iteration: Custom GPT (with a good example added, with role-play)**
* Included a good example and conducted scoring from both instructors' perspectives
* Inter-reliability between Architect GPT and Architect Instructor: **0.7199**, high reliability +**0.3257**
* Inter-reliability between Engineer GPT and Engineer Instructor: **0.5554**, moderate reliability +**0.3155**
* Inter-reliability between two GPts: **0.5536**, moderate reliability +**0.0261**
* Comparison of ICC Reliability for Iteration 3 (Part II with role-playing) in Table 6

**Discussion:**
- The results show that inter-reliability increases progressively as the GPts adapt to the nuanced expectations of human instructors.
- In each iteration with role-playing, the inter-reliability between Architecture GPT and Engineering GPT is above 0.5 while inter-reliability between human Architecture and Engineering instructors is only 0.167.
- Possible reasons for higher ICC results in general GPts compared to custom GPts:
  - Roleplaying adds complexity as the model simulates different instructional perspectives.
  - Custom GPt struggles to adapt its grading process when switching between these varied perspectives without a good example.

### 4.3 (Part III) Intra-reliability of GPT accessed in three diKerent times

**GPT Scoring Reliability: Intra-Reliability Study Results**

**Assumption 3 Verification**:
- Researchers checked GPT's scoring consistency across different times using General GPT
- Three comparisons were conducted on different days

**Project Scores Over Time (ICC Values)**:
| Project | 1st time | 2nd time | 3rd time | ICC with 1st | ICC between 2nd and 3rd | ICC between 1st and 3rd |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Accessed on: May 21, 2024 | 89 | 92 | 89 | 0.6485 (ICC) | N/A | N/A |
| Accessed on: May 27, 2024 | 94 | 93 | N/A | 0.7336 (ICC between 1st and 2nd) | N/A | N/A |
| Accessed on: June 3, 2024 | 78 | 79 | N/A | 0.7750 (ICC between 2nd and 3rd) | N/A | 0.6983 (ICC between 1st and 3rd) |

**Assumption 3 Conclusion**:
- High intra-reliability of GPT is confirmed with an ICC greater than 0.5 for repeated scoring at different times.

### 4.4 Custom GPTâ€™s role in providing feedback

**GPT's Role in Providing Timely Feedback for Design Students:**
