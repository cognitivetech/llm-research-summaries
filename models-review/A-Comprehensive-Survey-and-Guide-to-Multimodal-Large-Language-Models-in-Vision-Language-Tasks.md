**Certified Robustness:**
- Extending certified robustness techniques to multimodal settings is an open problem that requires new theoretical frameworks and practical implementations.
  * Adaptation of approaches like randomized smoothing for handling the complexities of multiple input modalities and their interactions is needed.

**Transferability of Attacks:**
- Understanding and mitigating transferability of adversarial examples across modalities and model architectures is crucial for developing robust MLLMs.
  * Investigating how adversarial perturbations in one modality can affect processing in other modalities and developing defense mechanisms to handle these complex attack scenarios is required.

**Robustness to Input Perturbations:**
- Ensuring consistent performance under various input conditions is crucial for reliable MLLM deployment in real-world applications.
  * Maintaining robust performance becomes particularly challenging in multimodal settings, where perturbations can affect different modalities independently or in combination.

**Visual Robustness**:
- Developing models robust to visual noise, occlusions, and transformations is challenging and requires sophisticated approaches to maintain performance across a wide range of visual conditions.
  * Techniques like adversarial training need adaptation for multimodal contexts to improve visual robustness without compromising clean data performance.

**Linguistic Variations**:
- Addressing robustness to linguistic variations, including typos, dialects, and non-standard language use, is crucial for creating MLLMs that can effectively serve diverse user populations.
  * Recent work on text perturbation strategies could be extended to multimodal settings to systematically evaluate and improve robustness to linguistic variations while maintaining cross-modal understanding.

**Cross-modal Consistency**:
