## Annotated translation of its CEO's deepest interview

**Deepseek: A Leading Chinese AI Startup**

**Achievements**:
- **Outperformed OpenAI's o1 model** on multiple reasoning benchmarks
- Funded by High-Flyer, a top 4 Chinese quantitative hedge fund valued at $8 billion
- Focuses on building foundational technology and open sourcing all models
- Affordable API rates due to access to High-Flyer's compute clusters (estimated 50k Hopper GPUs)

**Ambition to Build AGI**:
- No mention of safety, competition or stakes for humanity in mission statement

## Uncovering DeepSeek: The Ultimate Tale of Chinese Tech Idealism

**DeepSeek: The Profitable AI Startup**

**Background:**
- One of China's seven large-model startups
- Discreet but memorable for innovative approaches
- Backed by High-Flyer, a quantitative hedge fund
- Released open-source model DeepSeek V2 with unprecedented price/performance ratio

**Innovation:**
- Proposed novel MLA (multi-head latent attention) architecture
- Reduced memory usage to 5-13% of MHA
- Minimized computational costs through original DeepSeekMoESparse structure

**Impact:**
- Dubbed "Pinduoduo of AI" due to low prices
- Triggered price war among tech giants (ByteDance, Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba)
- Recognized for exceptional paper and architectural innovation by industry insiders

**DeepSeek's Unique Approach:**
- Focus on research and technology without TOC applications
- Open-source route without raising capital
- Values learning through "detours" instead of following trends

**Founder:**
- Liang Wenfeng: post-80s founder, low-key style, strong infra engineering and modeling capabilities, ability to mobilize resources, rare combination of accuracy and geekiness.

**DeepSeek's Philosophy:**
- Puts "right and wrong" before "profits and losses"
- Sees the inertia of the times and prioritizes original innovation

**Note:** The provided text is a translated version from Simplified Chinese. Some terms or phrases might have been approximated for better understanding.

## Part 1: How was the first shot of the price war fired?

**DeepSeek V2's Impact on the Large-Model Market**
* **Price War**: Triggered by DeepSeek V2's release, leading to intense competition among industry players
* **Unexpected Outcome**: Price cuts were not initially intended as a user poaching strategy
* **DeepSeek's Principles**: No subsidization or exorbitant profits; small profit margin above costs
* **Followed by Competitors**: Zhipu AI, ByteDance, Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, and others followed suit
* **Motivations for Price Cuts**:
	+ Decreased costs from exploring new model architectures
	+ Belief that APIs and AI should be accessible to everyone

**DeepSeek vs. Current Generation Architectures**
* **Model Structure Research**: Focus on scaling up to larger models with stronger capabilities
* **Fundamental Research Areas**: Data construction, making models more human-like
* **Gap in Efficiency**: Chinese models estimated to have a twofold gap compared to international frontier levels in training dynamics and data efficiency

**DeepSeek's Focus on Technological Innovation**
* **Belief in China's Contribution**: As the economy develops, China should become a contributor instead of freeriding
* **Previous Role**: Previously focused on application monetization while others innovated technologically
* **Current Approach**: Participate in the global innovation wave and drive ecosystem development.

## Part 2: The Real Gap Isn’t One or Two Years. It’s Between Original Innovation and Imitation.

**Surprising Innovation from DeepSeek V2**
- **DeepSeek V2**: Surprised many people in Silicon Valley due to:
  - Chinese company contributing to innovation
  - Lack of expectation for Chinese companies to innovate

**Challenges and Reasons for Lack of Innovation in China**
- High cost of innovation
- Past tendencies toward indiscriminate borrowing
- Lack of confidence and knowledge in organizing high-density talent for effective innovation

**Rapid Commercialization as Priority**
- Emphasis on making money instead of innovation
- Innovation requires curiosity and desire to create
- Old habits tied to a particular economic phase

**Open Source Innovation and Moats**
- Moats created by closed source are temporary
- Open source publishing and contribution earns respect and cultural attraction
- Team development and organization form the basis of innovation

**Zhu Xiaohu's Perspective**
- Logically consistent but more suitable for fast money-making companies
- Focus on technical leadership less effective in large models

**Importance of Exploration and Originality**
- Chinese AI can't be a perpetual follower
- Need to explore new technologies and trends
- Lack of supporting ecosystems hinders progress

**Nvidia's Leadership**
- Result of the entire Western technical community and industry working together
- Roadmap for next generation technology trends.

## Part 3: More Investments Do Not Equal More Innovation

**DeepSeek and High-Flyer:**

**Background:**
- Idealistic aura reminiscent of early OpenAI days
- Open source
- Founded by Liang Wenfeng
- Focus on foundational models and cutting-edge innovation

**Business Strategy:**
- No financing plans in the short term
- Belief in strong technical ecosystem
- Ultimate goal: achieving AGI

**Competition:**
- No worries about competition from big firms
- Competitors may undergo significant transformations or disappear
- Focus on creating an industry value chain for foundational large models

**Technological Advantage:**
- No absolute technological secrets, but replication requires time and cost
- Nvidia graphics cards are easy to replicate but building a team takes time
- Belief in specialized division of labor

**Future Outlook:**
- Two or three large model startups may survive
- Some companies might undergo significant transformations
- Focus on making society more efficient.

## Part 4: A group of young people doing “inscrutable” work

**DeepSeek V2 and Its Innovation**:
- **Jack Clark**, former policy director at OpenAI and co-founder of Anthropic, described DeepSeek as hiring "inscrutable wizards"
- However, **Liang Wenfeng** from DeepSeek clarified that the team is mostly fresh graduates from top universities, PhD candidates, and young people
- The idea for MLA innovation came from a young researcher's personal interest, which took months of effort to turn into reality
- DeepSeek's organizational structure is entirely bottom-up, with no predefined roles or hierarchies
- Team members can access GPUs and collaborate across teams as long as there's mutual interest
- Hiring at DeepSeek focuses on passion and curiosity, often recruiting people with unusual experiences

**Comparison of Innovations at Big Companies vs. Startups**:
- Companies like Google's AI Lab, OpenAI, and Chinese tech companies' AI labs are immensely valuable
- OpenAI's success was partly due to "historical coincidences"
- Innovation starts with believing in the possibility, which is more prevalent among young people

**Challenges and Future of AGI**:
- OpenAI is not a "god" and won't necessarily always be at the forefront
- AGI progress is meeting expectations, but there's no unified roadmap within DeepSeek
- Key directions for AGI research include mathematics/code, multimodality, and natural language itself
- The end game may involve specialized companies providing foundation models and services

## Part 5: All the methods are products of a previous generation

**Changes in China's Model Startups**

**Wang Huiwen**:
- Co-founder of RenRen (a Facebook clone) and Meituan (food delivery company)
- Withdrew from the startup scene mid-year
- Absorbed losses, allowing others to withdraw unscathed
- Decent conduct admired by Liang Wenfeng

**Lightyear**:
- Foundation model company founded by Wang Huiyuan, quickly folded into Meituan

**Liang Wenfeng's Focus**:
- Mainly focusing on researching next generation of large models
- Unsolved problems in this area

**Other Large Model Startups**:
- Pursuing both technology and commercialization
- Technology may not bring permanent leadership
- Capitalizing on window of opportunity to translate advantages into products

**DeepSeek**:
- Focusing on model research due to insufficient capabilities

**High-Flyer**:
- Quant fund with strong foundation in technology and innovation
- Relatively smooth growth
- Long accumulation process despite not being all smooth sailing

**Innovation Amid Economic Decline**:
- Possibility of suppressing basic research
- Adjustment of China's industrial structure relies more on hardcore technological innovation
- Making quick money may become more difficult, leading to increased focus on genuine innovation

**Optimism and Education for Innovation**:
- Liang Wenfeng grew up in the 1980s, saw opportunities in Guangdong
- Parents' perspective changed from valuing making money over studying
- Hardcore innovation will become increasingly common as society adapts
