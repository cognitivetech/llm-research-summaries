## Abstract
**Role-playing for Large Language Models (LLMs)**:
- LLMs can simulate human behaviors through role-playing
- However, they often perform poorly when confronted with knowledge outside their assumed role or questions requiring specific experience/logic

**Role-playing for Large Language Models (LLMs)**:
- LLMs can simulate human behaviors through role-playing
- However, they often perform poorly when confronted with knowledge outside their assumed role or questions requiring specific experience/logic

**Addressing the Problem: Thinking Before Speaking (TBS) Model**:
- Proposed approach to help LLMs adopt the role's thought process and logic
- Involves extending the data based on character's real-life scenarios and historical dialogue, supplemented with mindset information
- Adding few data points beyond the role's knowledge to fine-tune the LLMs
- Helps LLMs avoid responses that fall outside the role's knowledge base

**Dataset and Evaluation Metrics**:
- A dataset has been prepared for testing these capabilities
- Experimental results show that the TBS model can better emulate a role in terms of tone, knowledge, and mindset.

## Introduction

**Large Language Models (LLMs)**
- Emergence: more similar to human language answers, coherent conversations
- Capabilities: natural language processing, instruction following, summarizing, translating, writing
- Role of LLMs: dialogue systems and human assistants
- Research findings: role-playing is a form of character mimicking (Shanahan et al., 2023)

**Challenges in Role-Playing with LLMs:**
1. **Information loss**: LLMs may forget their roles during multiple rounds of dialogue, resulting in poor user experience and out-of-character replies.
2. **Context constraints**: Due to context length constraints, LLMs cannot learn enough information about the roles or become familiar with a character's knowledge scope.
3. **Lack of authentic emulation**: Despite generating responses based on historical dialogues, LLMs do not fully mimic the character's logic and thought process.
4. **Limited approaches for improvement:** Current research focuses on designing prompts (Li et al., 2023) or expanding datasets and fine-tuning models (Chen et al., 2024b; Wang et al., 2023b; Zhou et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023).
5. **Overlooked aspects:** Both methods primarily focus on enabling the LLM to generate responses that echo a character's tone and content without considering their experience-based choices in varying scenarios.

**Proposed Solution: Thinking Before Speaking (TBS) Model**
1. Generate realistic responses by thinking about character logic before responding
2. Expand character dialogue datasets through scenario generation and persona expansion
3. Set new technologies or negative samples to prevent the model from answering questions beyond a character's knowledge.

**Contributions:**
- Proposed TBS model for generating more realistic role-playing responses
- Added character mindset and unfamiliar technologies to enhance performance
- Expanded evaluation dataset and proposed new metrics to measure LLMs' role-playing ability.

**Related Work on Role-Play**

**Prompts for Role-Playing**:
- Use prompts to induce LLMs to perform role-playing tasks
- Design a special prompt with the character's name, profile, and history of conversations
- The model learns how to respond in that character's manner

**Examples**:
- **Li et al.** (2023) - Designed a special prompt for LLMs to perform role-playing
- **Zhou et al.** (2023) - Provided the model with the character's name, profile, and historical dialogue

**Advantages of Prompts**:
- Does not require computational resources to train LLMs
- Can be quickly extended with new roles
- Limited by input length of LLMs, affecting their understanding of the role
- Need to introduce a large amount of role-related information may decrease responsiveness to user queries

**SFT (Fine-tuning) Approach**:
- Makes LLMs learn a character's conversational style by re-training or fine-tuning them
- Does not require mentioning the currently played role in the prompt again
- Can fully utilize the limited input length of the LLMs
- Model obtained is more capable of imitating the role
- Requires a large amount of data for training
- Ability of the model depends on the quality of the dataset

**Evaluation**:
- **Conversational Competence**: Evaluating completeness, informativeness, fluency, ethical standards, and avoiding harmful content
- **Imitation of Characters**: Evaluating linguistic style, knowledge, personality, thinking process

## Model

**TBS Model Overview**
- Combines special prompts with fine-tune method
- Feeds character profile, historical dialogue, and out of character knowledge into Language Models (LLMs)
- LLMs are then fine-tuned to learn the character's knowledge and improve stability during role-play

**Model Components:**
- **Role Profile**: Provides a brief summary of a character's life experiences, relationships, main storyline etc. from Wikipedia
- **History Dialogue**: Includes relationships between characters, actual dialogue pairs, generated dialogue by imitation, and character mindset for each dialogue
- **Hallucination Knowledge**: Information outside the character's knowledge, designed to induce LLMs to generate responses without answering questions beyond the character's knowledge

**Training Prompt:**
- Organize character data into a special prompt
- Train LLMs using LoRA (Lambda Optimizer for Robust Adaptation)
- Input role profile summary and dialogue pairs into prompts as shown in Table 1

**Scenario:**
- Character is asked to act like and respond as RÃ´le Name
- Generate responses based on character thoughts and relationships, unfamiliar with things beyond knowledge

**Data Construction:**
- Crawl all data of characters from Wikipedia: main introduction, personality development, personal experiences over time, physical features, personality traits, and main skills
- Summarize information due to length limitations in LLMs input
- Use summarized profiles to make responses more consistent.

### Dialogues

**Expanding Dialogue Dataset for LLMs**
* Gather real dialogue data:
  * Scripted characters from scripts
  * Spoken words of real characters online
* Divide character's life experience into segments
* Generate stories based on segments using LLMs
* Generate dialogues based on profiles, experiences, and scenarios
* Ensure maintaining the same tone and vocabulary as historical dialogues
* Extract dialogue pairs from real and mimic-generated conversations
* Input current scene and character profiles into LLMs for response generation
* Introduce character's thinking process to dialogues.

**Generating Scenarios for Dialogue**
* Relevant to character's experience
* Design scenes around main character {a g e n t\_n a m e}
* Use imagination, include all aspects of life
* Transport back to historical era and setting
* Specific location, characters, and detailed background.

**Generating Thought Process for Dialogues**
* Outline thought process of {agent_name} as they articulate dialogue
* Pay attention to personality, knowledge, tone, character relationships
* Consider characters' relationships mentioned in the dialogue
* Speculate on character's thought process based on understanding and relationships.

### Hallucination Knowledge

**Hallucination Knowledge: Avoiding Hallucinations in Role-Playing Models**

**Problem:**
- LLMs struggle to avoid answering questions beyond their role's knowledge
- Fine-tuning or prompting does not always prevent out-of-scope questions

**Solution Proposed:**
1. Generate scenarios of out-of-scope questions
2. Prompt LLMs to generate dialogues about those scenarios
3. Fine-tune using LoRA with a small amount of out-of-scope knowledge

**Steps to solve the problem:**
1. **Generate Scenarios:**
   - Create situations where role imitators appear on the internet
   - Prompt LLMs to generate 20 questions leading them into revealing something beyond their role's knowledge (e.g., Beethoven's)

2. **Prompting LLMs:**
   - Generate dialogues about scenarios using indirect questioning for out-of-scope knowledge

3. **Fine-tuning with LoRA:**
   - Process data into fine-tune format of LLM
   - Fine-tune the LLM using LoRA with examples of train data from scenarios and generated dialogues.

**Instructions for Training Data:**
- Act like a specific character (e.g., {agent_name})
- Character's thoughts and speech: "..."
- Output: Character's speech

**Example of Train Data:**
Instructions: "I want you to act like {agent_name}..."
Character's thoughts and speech: "...'", output: "{agent_name}" (thinking):"..."
Character's speech: "...", output: "{agent_name}" (speaking):"..."
